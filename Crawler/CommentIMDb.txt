<StartTitletext>Leaves a lot to be desired<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSI don&#x27;t usually do reviews but this film was such a huge disappointment
I couldn&#x27;t fight it anymore. The original movie was so good and,
considering this is the exact same movie, there was really not much
that could go wrong. In theory of course, because in reality the final
result is just soulless. Everything feels fake. From Emma Watson&#x27;s
acting to the cgi and the props. I love Emma Watson but in this film
she is just playing herself trying to play Belle. To be fair though, no
one in the film actually manages to instill the characters with the
same emotion and personality as the original except maybe Josh Gad.
Luke Evans is very good but his character is written as a villain from
the start, while in the original he evolves from slightly annoying to
&#x22;evil&#x22;. Which brings me to my next point: the awful writing. The film
treats the audience like we&#x27;re stupid and needs to explain everything
verbally instead of just letting things show through the action. The
characters are one dimensional and don&#x27;t change as the story unfolds.
Gaston is the villain. The Beast is just a misunderstood soul from the
beginning despite the prologue telling us otherwise. Even his bad
temper is watered down. The writers had already the script written for
them, all they had to do was add a few more lines here and there and
create two or three scenes that would blend in seamlessly with the
original (since, I repeat, they chose to use almost word for word the
1991 script with minor changes). Well, the new dialogue feels very
wooden and unnatural. The new scenes add nothing to the story and, even
though the creators try to answer some questions we have from the
original, in the end they create new plot holes that go unanswered. I
miss the subtlety of the 1991 film in which every expression, every
line and every pause added something either to the progression of the
story or the characterization of the heroes without anything feeling
forced. I keep mentioning the original a lot but that is because this
movie has nothing new to offer really, so I can&#x27;t fully separate it
from the 1991 one. In the end, what annoys me the most is that the 2017
remake had great potential to become a new classic and stand on its own
had it been handled a little differently and not with a rushed &#x22;let&#x27;s
make some good money&#x22; mentality. There are very few good things about
this movie, one of which is the music which is simply magical and
manages to convey all the emotions the actors can&#x27;t. Then there is the
ending (after the transformation) where there is a more realistic touch
as the villagers remember their friends-relatives that work at the
castle and are finally reunited. Overall, despite the enormous hype,
the movie just makes the original stand out even more as a timeless
film that won&#x27;t be surpassed by another adaptation any time soon.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A meandering and dull mess. One of the biggest disappointments in recent years.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Sure, I&#x27;m a huge film snob who (on the surface) only likes artsy-fartsy
foreign films from before the 60&#x27;s, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped me from
loving Disney&#x27;s Beauty &#x26; The Beast; in fact, it&#x27;s probably my favorite
American animated film and is easily Disney&#x27;s finest work. It&#x27;s
beautiful, it&#x27;s breathtaking, it&#x27;s warm, it&#x27;s hilarious, it&#x27;s
captivating, and, in Disney fashion, it&#x27;s magical. When I learned that
Disney would be remaking their classic films, B&#x26;TB was undeniably the
best wrapped package. How could they go wrong?Oh man, they went wrong.First thing&#x27;s first: this film is so flat. The directing was dull and
uninteresting throughout the entire film and it honestly felt like one
of the Twilight sequels...and then I looked it up and found out that,
yes, director Bill Condon was the man behind Breaking Dawn parts 1 &#x26; 2.
Every shot looks bored and uninterested, which contrasts heavily with
the original animated film that was constantly popping with vibrancy.
The script too is boring because it&#x27;s almost a complete remake of the
original, though I guess most people won&#x27;t mind that.Next: the CGI is horrid. Although I didn&#x27;t care for The Jungle Book
from last year, I could at least admit that the CGI was breathtaking.
The same cant be said for this film. Characters like Lumi&#xE8;re,
Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, and most of the cursed appliances have very
strange, lifeless faces that are pretty off putting to be looking at
for such a long time. All of the sets too look artificial and fake,
especially the town towards the beginning. However, the biggest
offender is easily and infuriatingly the character that mattered most:
The Beast. The CGI on the Beast&#x27;s face is so distracting that it
completely takes you out of the film. His eyes are completely devoid of
soul, and his mouth is a gaping video game black hole of fiction. Klaus
Kinski looked much better in the Faerie Tale Theatre episode of Beauty
&#x26; The Beast, and that was a 1984 TV show episode. But do you know why
it looked better? Because it was an actual face with actual eyes, not
some video game computerized synthetic monstrosity. When will studios
learn that practical effects will always top CGI?Finally: wasted casting. Emma Watson is beautiful, but she&#x27;s no Belle.
She is completely devoid of the warmth and humanity that made the
animated Belle so beloved. Instead, she is cold and heartless
throughout most of the film. Kevin Kline is 100% wasted and does
nothing except look old. Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson,
and even Dan Stevens as the Beast are very expendable and could&#x27;ve been
played by anyone else. The only good characters are Gaston and LeFou,
mostly because they are fun and played by actors who breathe new life
into their original shapes. If anything, this film should&#x27;ve been about
Gaston and LeFou, but that would never happen because that would mean
Disney couldn&#x27;t cater to blind nostalgic 90&#x27;s kids.Overall, this film is a complete bore. It could&#x27;ve been better if even
the special effects were good, but the CGI in particular is horrendous.
I&#x27;m all for Disney remaking their nostalgia- catering 90&#x27;s films, but
they need to be interesting. This film, sadly, is not. Even the
Christmas sequel is better than this film because it&#x27;s at least
something.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Water and CGI does not an instant classic make<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it&#x27;s their
masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a new version was in
the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was
shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed
singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst
CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages. A film that is over 50% GCI, should focus on making that part
believable, unfortunately for this film, it&#x27;s far from that. It looks
like the original film was ripped apart frame by frame and the
beautiful hand-painted drawings have been replaced with digital
caricatures. Besides CGI that is bad, it&#x27;s mostly creepy. As the little
teacup boy will give me nightmares for several nights to come. Emma
Watson plays the same character as she always does, with very little
acting effort and very little conviction as Belle. Although I can see
why she was cast in the film based on merits, she is far from the right
choice for the role. Dan Stevens does alright under as some motion
captured dead-eyed Beast, but his performance feels flat as well. Luke
Evans makes for a great pompous Gaston, but a character that has little
depth doesn&#x27;t really make for a great viewing experience. Josh Gad is a
great comic relief just like the original movie&#x27;s LeFou. Other than
that, none of the cast stands out enough for me to remember them. Human
or CHI creature. I was just bored through out the whole experience. And
for a project costing $160 000 000, I can see why the PR department is
pushing it so hard because they really need to get some cash back on
this pile of wet stinky CGI-fur!All and all, I might be bias from really loving Disney&#x27;s first
adaptation. That for me marks the high-point of all their work,
perfectly combining the skills of their animators along with some CGI
in a majestic blend. This film however is more like the bucket you wash
off your paintbrush in, it has all the same colors, but muddled with
water and to thin to make a captivating story from. The film is quite
frankly not worth your time, you would be better off watching the
original one more time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Moral of the Story: Marry for Money<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast is about a deposed slave-owning aristocrat who
imprisons a farm girl. She undergoes Stockholm Syndrome, identifying
with her captor, then proceeds to betray her village&#x27;s uprising and
reinstates the slave-owning prince to power by offering her hand in
marriage.Furthermore, Belle&#x27;s contempt for the provincial farming community and
their lack of refinement stems from vague memories she has of a more
cultured upbringing in Paris. When she later is shown a vision of her
childhood house and remarks &#x22;it&#x27;s so small,&#x22; this was a moment where
she could put it all together. The lack of refinement in the rural areas was due to brutal
exploitation which forced unmarried women to beg in the streets. It is
likely that the community&#x27;s surplus resources were taken by aristocrats
like the Beast, and used to fund his opulent palace. Thus, depriving
the farming community of leisure time and resources for education and
arts, which would have made them more sophisticated, meeting Belle&#x27;s
approval.It is also possible that Gaston&#x27;s intense desire to marry, which caused
his nefarious plot, may be linked to lev&#xE9;e en masse, a policy that
required conscription for all unmarried French men between 18 and 25.
So his patriarchal demands were a direct result of state policy to
benefit the aristocracy by providing soldiers to sacrifice their lives
in land disputes between inbred blue blood cousins.Then, this exploitation provided a concentration of wealth and power in
the city, which created the market for her father to pursue creative
employment rather than farm work. This also forced them into slums,
where squalor and poor public health systems lead to the spread of
plague, which is met with cold indifference by the doctor, indicating
lack of public health care as a source of Belle&#x27;s childhood trauma. All of this exploitation and upward wealth transfer made its way back
to the remote plantation of the Beast.When confronted with this inescapable logic, what does she do? She
decides to take the easy way out and enjoy the life of luxury, waited
hand and foot by Beast&#x27;s slaves, who feed her, clothe her, sing and
dance for her. A life she always felt entitled to, on part of her
feeling of superiority towards her provincial neighbors.The moral of the story is, marry for money, and ignore the suffering of
the poor. A terrible message for children.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The corporate version of Beauty And The Beast: Disney at it&#x27;s most generic and dull<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear: where should I start folks. I had low
expectations already because I hated each and every single trailer so
far, but boy did Disney make a blunder here. I&#x27;m sure the film will
still make a billion dollars - hey: if Transformers 11 can do it, why
not Belle? - but this film kills every subtle beautiful little thing
that had made the original special, and it does so already in the very
early stages. It&#x27;s like the dinosaur stampede scene in Jackson&#x27;s King
Kong: only with even worse CGI (and, well, kitchen devices instead of
dinos).The worst sin, though, is that everything (and I mean really
EVERYTHING) looks fake. What&#x27;s the point of making a live-action
version of a beloved cartoon if you make every prop look like a prop? I
know it&#x27;s a fairy tale for kids, but even Belle&#x27;s village looks like it
had only recently been put there by a subpar production designer trying
to copy the images from the cartoon. There is not a hint of
authenticity here. Unlike in Jungle Book, where we got great looking
CGI, this really is the by-the-numbers version and corporate filmmaking
at its worst. Of course it&#x27;s not really a &#x22;bad&#x22; film; those 200 million
blockbusters rarely are (this isn&#x27;t &#x27;The Room&#x27; after all), but it&#x27;s so
infuriatingly generic and dull - and it didn&#x27;t have to be. In the hands
of a great director the potential for this film would have been huge.Oh and one more thing: bad CGI wolves (who actually look even worse
than the ones in Twilight) is one thing, and the kids probably won&#x27;t
care. But making one of the two lead characters - Beast - look equally
bad is simply unforgivably stupid. No wonder Emma Watson seems to phone
it in: she apparently had to act against an guy with a green-screen in
the place where his face should have been.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An Autotuned Mess<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This adaptation is a disgrace to the original. Watson&#x27;s voice is auto-
tuned to death and the Beast CGI wasn&#x27;t good. Each time the Beast
popped up, he was very off putting. Watson&#x27;s line deliveries are poor
and doesn&#x27;t do the animated princess justice. She also seems a bit too
young for the role. She is a total miscast. Despite the Beast&#x27;s CGI, at
least his performance was very good as both the Beast and Prince
compared to Watson. Emma Thompson&#x27;s rendition of Tale as Old as Time
does not beat the animated tea cup, but at least she was not auto tuned
to death. There are very few moments of originality as it is a frame by
frame copy to the animated film. It&#x27;s very uninspiring and unnecessary.0/10.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Plain<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Where do I start. This adaptation of Disney&#x27;s 1991 Beauty and the Beast
was an utter disappointment. Emma Watson as Belle was extremely
unconvincing from the start to the end. She had the same expressions as
the actress from Twilight. The animators did a terrible job with the
Beast. He looked fake and lifeless. They could have used special makeup
to create the beast similar to the Grinch where we get to see Jim
Carrey&#x27;s expressions. The side character animations were poorly
executed. Overall I felt the film was rushed as there was lack of
compassion and chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of CGI
and green screen which could have been replaced by normal acting,
because then why make an animated version of an animated film? This is
by far the worst remake of an animated classic.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Don&#x27;t bother stick with the original cartoon<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
My Childhood destroyed just re-watch the cartoon, don&#x27;t bother don&#x27;t
waste a dollar. Poor acting poor everything. I don&#x27;t even want to waste
another minute explaining why and how horrible. Just means i&#x27;ll need to
relive it !!!! A little tip to Disney, you don&#x27;t need to pick someone
whom is well known i.e. Emma Whatfor.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>As boring and emotionless as twilight<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Was lifeless, characters had no emotion or personality , found myself
rooting for gaston, he was the only cool one. Modern autotuned garbage.
CGI was awful and way overdone. Nothing like the original. Songs were
long and annoying. Dialogue felt rushed like they tried to cram all the
stuff from the original into it but ran out of time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>One of the worst Disney movies ever<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Bad movie for sure. Disney movies are most of the times one of the best
I have ever seen, but not always this is true which is the case here.
This movie was so boring so I was wandering what to do 1 hour and 50
minutes, only the last 10 minutes of the movie is worth seeing. Budget
160 millions dollars and the result is total disappointment. All this
musical elements in the movie is just too much, it takes away the real
feeling that this movie is supposed to bring to the viewers. Ema Watson
clearly is worst choice for this role, she was looking like Beast&#x27;s
daughter when standing next to him, she is just too young for this
role. This movie should be rated not to be viewed by viewers over 16
years of age. Overall very bad movie, it is a clear waste of time to
see this movie, but we will forget Disney and will wait for them to get
back on track this month of May.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>characters<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The face of the beast is like the face of a person coupled with that of
a bulldog,the horns of the beast are taken from a goat,the clothes in
the part of the hair against the wolves is very well achieved,Gaston
instead of being a strong person seems to just leave a slimming diet,
the only character that has improved since the first movie is the
Gaston squad
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>CGI doesn&#x27;t make this movie get better!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Just saw the movie about a month ago. At the first time, I think this
live-action will be as good as the animation movie its which has been
successful before but the result just &#x22;Extremely disappointed!&#x22;. The
director of &#x22;Twilight 2&#x22;... oh and now I just realized! Both the film
just boring like the same!May be the script of the movie will make the viewer thinking it looks
something interesting and fresh but it&#x27;s not; for some reasons: 1. Actors also did not attract the audience. 2. This movie just SING and SING!! 3. The director seems to have invested too much in the costume, image
to make the film become brilliant, attractive but he forgot that the
movie was nothing special, run out of ideas (viewers can predict the
content). 4. I feel like the old scenes are repeated but modified for new looks!Finally, I recommend you: &#x22;Do not waste your time with a movie like
this! The animation movie its (1991) will be better for you&#x22;.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>How can this have so many talented actors and be this bad?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I am a huge fan of the original and I was thrilled when the cast was
announced. I&#x27;m a big fan of Emma Watson and most of the other
supporting actors so I went in with high hopes for this. It was awful!
The CGI and auto-tuning were distracting and poorly done. On the
subject of auto-tune- why did they insist Emma Watson do her own vocals
when she clearly wasn&#x27;t up to the task? Several other numbers, notably
&#x22;Gaston&#x22; and &#x22;Be our Guest&#x22; fell flat. None of the charm or warmth of
the original.The performances were another issue for me which blows my mind
considering the talent propping this horrid remake up. I can&#x27;t fathom
who approved the accents of Ewen Mcgregor and Emma Thompson. They were
BAD. Emma Watson&#x27;s performance was not what I expected from her. It was
like she was trying but missing the mark time and again. Her Belle is
condescending at times, bland in others, and overall forgettable.
**spoiler** When Gaston and the beast have their fight,in this version
instead of stabbing beast in the back, Gaston shoots him unexpectedly
like twice. Emma Watson&#x27;s &#x22;reaction&#x22; to this is a prime example of my
above complaints. She doesn&#x27;t seem shocked, sad, NOTHING. She waits
until he&#x27;s been shot a few times and has been down awhile before
changing emotion at all and even then her &#x22;sorrow&#x22; at his death is
horribly unbelievable. I could not believe this was Emma Watson
preforming in this way. The beast was eh, Lafou wasn&#x27;t funny (the
theater was at no point filled with laughter. My 10 year old laughed
twice the whole time), and the servants weren&#x27;t charming or at all like
their cartoon versions. I also hate that the funny back and forth
between Lumiere and Cogsworth wasn&#x27;t there. The only one I enjoyed was
Luke Evans as Gaston. He was far from perfect but I think he did best
out of everyone. As I scroll through the IMDb reviews with the occasional 8 or 9, and
pages of 2&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s, I can&#x27;t understand how the rating is a 7.8. I
give it a 2 for effort and can say with 100% certainty that I won&#x27;t
ever sit through it again. Another pointless remake. Disappointing.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Stick to the cartoon!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I must say, Disney seems to be putting out live action movies of their
successful cartoons just for the sake of putting out live action
movies! I guess corporate thinking is the initial buzz will make it
money on the first weekend! This is the worst of the live actions, the
acting is boring, the story mundane, I do not care about the characters
at all, it seems it&#x27;s just made to show how cool Disney can use special
effects! If you like the story, stick to the original cartoon!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Waste of time!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
2 words: Terrible &#x26; Waste of money. How on earth does this movie even
get 7.8!:score seriously!!!??? I found the French movie &#x22; Beauty and
the Beast &#x22; released in 2014 ten times better than this!! As a parent,
I though I was the only one, but my 4 year old who loves to listen to
this story when I read it to her was so bored .. that she asked&#x22; is
this movie finished yet&#x22;??? So I rest my case. Hahah.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Went with high hopes left with utter disgust<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The movie is bad. My now grown kids went with the wife and I. Kids wife
and I loved the cartoon version some 25 plus years back. This movie
don&#x27;t compare in any way. Kids are also life long Harry Potter fans and
thought they loved Emma Watson they went truly wishing to love this
movie they left feeling there money was stolen and swearing off Disney.
I felt I was stuck on a 2 hour lecture about the greatness of being a
liberal and found the movie sickening. Hey to each there own but I wish
never wasted a penny on this movie and I am a life long cartoon and kid
movie fan
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Fake historical facts, zero original music, average actors. Disappointed<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Once again I was convinced that Hollywood is dead. First of all, main
the Beast and the Beast auditory are kids and teenagers from age 6 to
age 18. So no big expectation for adult auditory. It is not supposed to
be masterpiece of all times. But even so... how you could misrepresent
historical facts like that? Medieval France. What we see? Black people
lived freely among white people, they dance happily together and drink
in one bar. I understand things about political correctness. But don&#x27;t
you think it makes movie look fake and misrepresent original fairy
tale. Secondly, music. Did you actually hire song writers, authors, musicians
for such big cinema event? There are some good songs. But it turned out
they are all classic French songs or taken from 1991 animated &#x22;The
beauty and the beast&#x22; movie.Thirdly, actors. Well, I have no complains to Emma Watson beauty.
Interesting young British actress. But Belle was French. French women
have special charm and chic(remember Amelie?). Emma Watson with her
solder walking and always the same face expression did not convince me.
Animated Belle expressed more emotions and love in her eyes that Emma
&#x22;Belle&#x22; Watson. As for other actors, was very pleased to see Kevin
Kline. Only actor in the movie which performance I enjoyed. Other
actors were very plain or their roles were so short that it is hard to
do something outstanding.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Torturing Disappointment<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The movie from the first scene up to the end was emotionless and
spiritless. I do appreciate that they didn&#x27;t want to change the story
much and keep the classic version for the most. Even when the movie was
slightly tweaked, it was in the wrong dull way. Some tweaks don&#x27;t
really make sense and don&#x27;t add up.I don&#x27;t know whom should be blamed for the &#x27;emotion delivery failure&#x27;
is it the cast or the director? Emma Watson is good actress for some
certain roles, but certainly not this one. She was very stiff. We
couldn&#x27;t differentiate her surprise from anger or love from sadness. In
many scenes Belle and the Beast were talking so fast with no emotions,
soul or spirit. It was as if they were rehearsing on a play by reading
out loud from their scripts and the director was simply not there.Cinematography had a problem too. Too many close ups. The original
cartoon had some close ups too, but Do they really have to copy
everything as-is? The couple dancing scene cinematography could have
been better.I really don&#x27;t advise anyone to see this movie. Disney failed this
time. It happens, though!. Hopefully we&#x27;ll know what really happened.

but British public don&#x27;t know there movies.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Extensive review **SPOILERS BELOW**<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;m going to share an unpopular opinion. I&#x27;m heartily sorry to my
fellow Disney fans, but I feel the need to say something: This
obsession/worship of the new Beauty and the Beast is BS.I saw this film with my 6-year-old a couple weeks ago. While there&#x27;s
plenty about which to gripe, here&#x27;s one of my biggest problems: I can&#x27;t
stand this constant CGI-heavy everything-must-be-a-sequel-or- a- remake
era of film making. It&#x27;s making movie makers lazy.Wanna make a buck? How about remake the biggest Disney films of all
time but in LIVE ACTION. OMG *heart emoji* *heart eyes emoji* *crying
emoji* *hands raised emoji*More like dollar signs. That&#x27;s all this film was about. Dollars.
Millions and millions of them. Yes, every film needs to make money, but
Disney isn&#x27;t hurting. They can afford to make quality films... and they
do! They really do. But this wasn&#x27;t one of them. This was a cash grab
and nothing more.Let&#x27;s focus on the visuals in the film. Stills from the finished
product were gorgeous. Everything was so intricate and colorful and on
such a huge scale. The problem is that it was literally everywhere.Go to an art gallery. There are canvases, stand alone sculptures,
photos, etc. All organized in a specific way. There&#x27;s a break between
each piece, whether by floor or wall, that allows you to digest it and
have a moment to reflect.Movies like B&#x26;TB are like the entire building in which you hold the
gallery is a &#x22;work of art&#x22;. There&#x27;s no space to reflect, just constant
stimulation. You haven&#x27;t a moment to enjoy the beauty and grandeur of
it all because it&#x27;s literally everywhere.Storytelling-wise, it was all over the place. They already had a basic
story thanks to the original, but you can&#x27;t just do that. You have to
add as much back story as you can, fill those plot holes, make it the
SAME but BETTER.They were shoehorning in so much that half the damn thing was
backstory. And it wasn&#x27;t told chronologically. Noooo, ma&#x27;am. That&#x27;s not
how the original was structured, so we CAN&#x27;T deviate from THAT. What
about the music? The music? You mean the mostly half-assed regurgitated
pile of those classic songs I loved listening to growing up and still
enjoy? And the extra songs shoved in just so that you always had
something to distract you from how they didn&#x27;t know how to write a
proper story with poignant and meaningful silences?Look. I love Emma Watson. I really do, but her voice... She sounded
weak. I&#x27;m sure she tried really hard, but she doesn&#x27;t have the vocal
chops for this. Don&#x27;t get me started on Ewan McGregor&#x27;s horrible accent
and lazy singing.The Beast was fine, but his song after Belle left totally ruined the
moment. He was supposed to be in pain and the moment in the original
film where he roared out the window was perfect. You understood his
sorry and his sacrifice. No song needed.And since when is Gaston NOT a baritone? To be fair, though, Gaston and
LeFou were the best thing about this whole mess. They should have just
done a movie about their war adventures and I would&#x27;ve been happy.They poured on the whole &#x22;LeFou is gay&#x22; thing a bit thick for my taste.
It was the only thing that added levity to the movie (despite how much
fun it should have been already), but it seemed a bit cheap. I&#x27;m not
going to apologize for wanting more for my LGBTQ characters than to be
just the comic relief.Want to know a CGI-heavy Disney remake that they did right?
Surprisingly enough... it was The Jungle Book. They took the old one,
used a couple of the songs, but made it completely their own. It was a
similar story, but they didn&#x27;t rely completely on it. Leave it to my
boy Jon Favreau to retell an old story with fake animals and make it
feel more real and original than anything in B&#x26;TB.That&#x27;s all I can think to say for now. Call me jaded and picky. It
might be true, but it&#x27;s also true that I have higher standards for my
movies... especially from Disney.TL;DR - Over-CGI&#x27;d-musical-number-heavy mess attempts to distract you
from the fan-service-and-needless-backstory-filled plot so that you

My title says it all. Even with releasing nude photos of herself and
playing it up as a &#x27;hack&#x27; Emma Watson fails to deliver in this
predictable, clich&#xE9;, gyno-centric feminist&#x27;s wet dream of a reboot.
You&#x27;d think Hollywood would stop trying to dictate what the audience
finds entertaining, but it seems nobody in Hollywood wants to make any
money anymore. Maybe the film / television industry is going the way of
the music industry. Maybe it should, the &#x27;talent&#x27; has been full of
themselves for far too long now.

Overall the film was decent, a bit boring at times. The acting was OK,
but it failed to ever &#x22;sweep you away&#x22; like the animated version did
for years. The most frustrating part was Belle, or Emma. I don&#x27;t dislike her and I
could care less about feminism. However, I do think a lead role that
includes substantial signing should be able to.......SING!The horrible use of auto-tune was cringe worthy and her English accent
was very thick for someone that was born in Paris and grew up in
France.... I though McGregor was great as Lumiere and hid his English accent well.
Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth are supposed to be English, so that worked
well.

I had the opportunity to watch this movie today and man it was
disappointing. It was boring. reason being perhaps that it felt like
the copy of the original. These were the great cartoons which we grew
up watching. But why would the same songs, characters, story be
entertaining for us, we could just watch the cartoons again, why bother
to remake. It might have been entertaining if characters were a little
believable at least. The beast lack any emotion. Emma Watson (though I
love her) was just trying to copy belle from the cartoons. She wasn&#x27;t
even given a chance to try to portray the character of belle and not
the &#x27;acting&#x27; of cartoon belle (she wasn&#x27;t even successful in that). The
only person I liked in the movie was Gaston. The rest of the characters
were soooo animated that it stole the real feel of the movie which
should really be the purpose of remaking a movie after all. A few new
songs were added which were quite boring. The village of belle was
aweeeefuulllll. Why Why Why would they make a village which just look
like a ground full of hideous people. Why not put a little more money
in that part. The reason of the movie should be to give a real life
feeling to fairy tales ( which jungle book and Cinderella gave), not to
just make it more cartoonish.stay away from this one and save your money
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An Honest Review<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
If it were in a theater rather than a cinema, it would have been great.But the fact is we saw this before when it was called Beauty &#x26; the
Beast.The songs we all heard before. Rather than an animated background you
have a computer animated background but we have still seen it before.We sit down and pay to watch a movie we already saw turn live action
and follow the same plot, the same game, as the movie we fell in love
with oh so many years ago.We are living in an era for that, but we still want it to change at
least a little.Like all remakes it is dull and boring and utterly mindless. Like all
remakes it makes changes that are unnecessary and irritating and in
some cases, fairly insulting to the fans of the original: Belle, not
her father, is the eccentric town inventor and that would, maybe, work
if he wasn&#x27;t supposed get locked up for being, well, the eccentric town
inventor with a story about a Beast.Take away the establishment of one character that is sort of necessary
to the plot and give it to another where it is less important to
advance the story and do it only because, well, it&#x27;s a remake, you have
to find at least one way to really insult the fans...And changes like this are the only way to do it because, otherwise, you
have the EXACT same movie you saw before with little changes made to
really just drag the monotony out as much as you can.I hate remakes, but the fact that it IS THE SAME MOVIE just makes it so
much more monotonous to watch than your average remake.

All these good reviews, all the praise, my local magazine reviewed it
in glowing terms and watching it last night (and I even dragged my very
unwilling boyfriend too) it felt like a copy. Yes, I know you are
laughing it is already a remake and yet another Beauty And The Beat,
but this is so similar to the one from the 90s we have all watched that
you will be sitting there asking &#x27;what is the point?&#x27; Still, pretty
sure Disney doesn&#x27;t care they got two tickets out of us, but if you
read this it is nothing new or different and the inclusion of a
so-called gay character is so irrelevant to the story and so ungay that
it makes no difference. If you have seen the multiple other Beauty And
The Beasts out there (animated or not) you have seen this. Disney must
be really hard up for cash. Do anything else, go out for dinner, cook
for your man, let him take you in front of the window, read a book,
update your keek or just unwind... you&#x27;d be ahead.

I don&#x27;t know where to begin. beauty and the beast Had so much potential
to be an extraordinary movie. THe village set was disappointing,
everything in the movie looked fake. The beast looked like a plastic
mask, the wolves I can&#x27;t even begin to say. I&#x27;m honestly just
disappointed in the movie. Only part I truly enjoy was the &#x22;be our
guest&#x22; performance. honestly should&#x27;ve left this movie alone. It made
me feel like I was watching those teen vampire movies( which I don&#x27;t
watch).
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Boring<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie is very overrated and the reason why the film is popular
because of its promotion. Emma Watson performance is really boring as
hell and her voice is not that good. I suggest you to watch the
original version (1991). Dan Stevens and Luke Evans performance is
pretty good tho. Overall, its the worst Disney film i&#x27;ve ever watched.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Missed Opportunity<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Come on Disney: what were you thinking?! You&#x27;ve got one of the most
beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever
that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new
version of that film to the director of &#x27;Twilight&#x27; parts 3 and 4? Has
anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon&#x27;s &#x27;Twilight&#x27; films or
did you just look at all the money they made during their opening
weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn
films who look better and have better plots (seriously).Now the good news is, &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; is nowhere near as bad as
the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to
those teen shlock movies. And that&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t get: if you have the
chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the
reviews are good) - wouldn&#x27;t you want to make sure to make the best
looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the
mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced
color-grading of a bowl of M&#x26;Ms.Emma Watson isn&#x27;t half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a
way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director
on her face (&#x22;now act SURPRISED&#x22; - &#x22;now show us a sense of WONDER&#x22; -
&#x22;now look SAD&#x22;). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted
because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a
certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is,
naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like
he&#x27;s having fun.But all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was
Beast. It&#x27;s mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets
a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don&#x27;t look
convincing yet. Beast&#x27;s face never looks real and that&#x27;s just not
acceptable. It&#x27;s been almost 10 years since we got a completely
convincing CGI &#x22;beast&#x22; face with Peter Jackson&#x27;s King Kong, complete
with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we
got films like &#x27;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&#x27; and &#x27;Jungle Book&#x27; that
looked even better and more realistic. So what happened? What did they
spend the 200 million budget on?I&#x27;m sorry to say it, but this film represents a huge missed opportunity
for Disney.

Like all Disney fans from the 80&#x27;s to present, I found myself excited
to see this live action adaptation once I saw the teaser poster! I
decided to ignore the naysaying that followed with the trailers, and
the wave of immoral rhetoric being associated with the sexuality of
LeFou. (Rolls eyes) Ignoring all of this I decided to make a judgement call after seeing
the movie. I&#x27;ve came to the conclusion that this movie is to Disney
movies what the original Blair witch was to the horror genre. This
movie apparently cost $160,000,000 which begs to question: Where did
they spend all this money? The sets designs and props were hastily put
together. The village at the opening looks like the village Dorothy
lands in, at the beginning of the wizard of oz. Next is the CGI! The
budget and expertise behind Disney should not have been lacking. This
movie could&#x27;ve been a cash cow. But the sad fact is, Disney let fine
details and lackadaisical work ethic be passed off as a masterpiece. Emma Watson is a tremendous actress, and this is evident in her ability
to phone in a wonderful performance to a imaginary beast. Disney
please, please... please heed this. When the Gorilla from &#x27;Mighty Joe
Young&#x27; a movie from 1998 looks more realistic than your beast in 2017
you must realize you&#x27;ve made a mistake. Disney used to be the go to for
amazing movies that left you with spirit and wonder. What they&#x27;ve
proved with their latest live action movies Is the realization, that
they just crank out regurgitated movies with less effort just to cash
in on nostalgia. From now on we will be renting Disney movies from
redbox instead of seeing them in theaters.

I&#x27;ve seen the original more times than I can count so I was very
excited when I heard about a live action version that sticks to the
original movie. While they did stick to the original for a good
portion, they changed many of the most iconic scenes and not in a good
way. For example, they cut out the scene where Belle&#x27;s father first
encounters the beast by the fireplace, which is my son&#x27;s favorite, and
replaced it with something far less interesting. They also managed, and
I don&#x27;t know how, to ruin the music. All of the songs are slowed down
so much that it&#x27;s hard to care about them and they&#x27;re lacking the
booming vocals that made the originals so good. They also added a lot
of unnecessary dialogue which makes for a much slower pace. Overall all
this movie just lacks the character of the original. We were so bored
that we actually left about half way through.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not too bad. But I personally felt that the 1991 version is still the best<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I think the problem with Disney live-action remakes, is that there&#x27;s
such awkwardness in the layout, I personally felt that in the case of
Beauty and the Beast, the live-action version can&#x27;t &#x22;perform&#x22; the story
very well, it appears to me that they are trying to tell the story with
a fusion that combines animation, movie and musical, a bit of
everything in everywhere, however I don&#x27;t really enjoy this experience.
The actors and actresses were fine considering the demands and
preference of the audiences (consumers), some of them did very well,
Like Gaston and LeFou. I think that Emma Watson looks very pretty on
screen as Belle, and her singing is okay, but I personally felt that
her acting is very stiff, her singing skills is very much not enough
for a musical. She is a very successful and smart celebrity, I think
she is a very good fashion and makeup model too, but her performances
(including Harry Potter, etc) on screen I&#x27;ve seen so far, haven&#x27;t
appear to me as a professional/convincing actress at all, I never seen
her looking like she is doing (performing, acting) something she
believes. As Belle Emma Watson sometimes looks miserable, like she is
forcing her face to hold on expression(disgusted, love, sad, etc.) that
she was told to. I felt that my money spent on the movie ticket was
burned watching her performance, and this isn&#x27;t the first time at all
when it comes to movies that has her in the cast, I remember feeling
really angry last time when I saw her performance in Harry Potter- The
Goblet of Fire, because I can&#x27;t believe I spent money to get to watch
such unprofessional performance of a pretty &#x22;actress&#x22; like her on a
mainstream movie, and now in B&#x26;TB she hasn&#x27;t improve at all. Overall I think everything on the screen appears to be pretty but also
boring (awkward). I personally much prefer the 1991 version, for me it
is one of the best from Disney. I kind of wish they didn&#x27;t do the
remake.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappointment<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
To start Disney come on the casting choices were not good. The movie
does not do justice to the original and i would imagine Walt in turning
in his grave. The CGI was HORRIBLE and i mean Absolutely Terrible. the
worst part is in my opinion this hurts the original because it may turn
younger people away that haven&#x27;t see the original animated version and
that is the one worth watching. I understand it will still make a ton
of money but that is not do to the content because it Garbage!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Worse than the original, in the same group of recent, meaningless releases from Disney like Rogue One<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
SPOILERS!! ---------- ----------I saw the original classics of the era - Beauty and the Beast, The
Little Mermaid, etc - so I was interested in seeing what this
live-action could do with the story. Here, Disney attempts to remake
their own animated version of Beauty and the Beast (BnB), but for
various reasons, it falls far short of the classic animated version
much like Rogue One fell far short of being a great Star Wars movie.1) The songs suck. One of the most glaring examples is when the Beast pines for Belle, and
sings his song while climbing up the tower stairs. Something along the
lines of &#x27;I&#x27;m climbing these stairs, then looking out the open window.&#x27;
This is repeated over and over as if we&#x27;re to sing along to the line or
be excited by it. Nope, complete fail.The songs lack the vocal power of the original ones, failing mostly to
inspire or make one tap one&#x27;s feet. No humming along to this movie -
it&#x27;s dead on arrival.2) The actors do not shine in their roles, sometimes, because the aura
around them is too strong from past movies, sometimes, they simply are
too generic for the role.For example, Belle&#x27;s dad is far too generic. One of those characters
you look at and forget right away, even after the whole movie was seen. The mysterious enchantress that enters in the beginning is nowhere near
a Maleficent or Snow White Witch - she looks like some generic female
that walked in, cursed the Beast, and you promptly forget.Others like Gaston (still think he&#x27;s from Fast and Furious), Watson
(her performance here is dead, unlike her more moving Potter
performances), etc. have the problem of being mismatched for the roles.3) Really bad scriptwriting.You&#x27;ve got lines with characters suddenly mentioning things out of the
blue, unmotivated. eg. Dad parks his horse, says &#x27;oh, there&#x27;s water and
hay.&#x27; Huh? Why? What does that add? Nothing. It would have been far
better for him to park the horse and cut to next scene.4) Movies should be something one can understand with the sound off,
but there are many examples of things that don&#x27;t make sense, and
characters breaking out of their roles.eg. If Gaston is really the battle hero he is, then why is he afraid of
a few wolves in the forest? He&#x27;s got a gun, guts, and strength, so why
not just charge in and save the day? Okay, so he&#x27;s played as a guy who
is all show and no real guts in this movie in this scene, but later,
he&#x27;s crazy enough to shoot the Beast several times, jump across big
gaps, etc.eg. The Beast is supposed to be a BEAST, but he takes a few bites from
attacking wolves and collapses, out of energy after the attack, wiped
out. Yet, in the end, he takes multiple gun shots from Gaston before
finally collapsing. eg. Belle falls in Love with the Beast after a few scenes of them
reading books, and he lets her go to save her dad. Huh?? Are girls
really that Easy?? There&#x27;s no motivation at all for a real girl to fall
in love with the Beast after a few days in captivity, so it&#x27;s
unbelievable based on how it is shown.4) A lot of the fun, the connection, the relationship between Belle and
the household items are lost. The animation had the interplay between them which you could see and
feel, eventually building up a very strong connection between Belle and
each of the items, like the teacup, the candle holder, etc. In this
movie, it was more of a show and tell - Belle sits back, things are
shown to her, and..that&#x27;s it. Moving on, much like a Disney Fantasy
ride - you see interesting displays, but no connection. Same for the
horse and Belle. In the animation, you can see the horse reacting to
the scary forest, setting up an undertone of fear and worry as they
enter the dark forest. But in this movie, none of that - it&#x27;s simply a
&#x27;machine&#x27; that she hops on, and it takes her to and from the Beast&#x27;s
home. 5) The lighting is uneven. There are places where it&#x27;s really good and
you can see the characters well-defined, then other places where it&#x27;s
just tough to see Belle and the surroundings (like the prison her dad
was kept in and just outside that). This is a far cry from Potter where
you can see inside the dimly lit school, but there&#x27;s definition and
more clarity to the details. Here, it simply goes black to dark gray
and there&#x27;s nothing there to add to the scene.6) Too many competing messages and periods.You&#x27;ve got Belle implying she doesn&#x27;t need/want to get married in the
beginning, then wanting to stay forever with the Beast in a few days.
Yet, they look like they&#x27;re living in the old ages, before the 20th
century. You&#x27;ve got Gaston with a gun, yet when the town attacks the Beast, most
don&#x27;t have a gun?! Are we in the swords and stone age, or gun age?You&#x27;ve got lots of white characters, then, the mandatory politically
correct insertion of a black female here and there.You&#x27;ve got Belle saying &#x27;I&#x27;m not normal&#x27; (ie. I&#x27;m not the usual cute
girl that gets married young, has kids, etc), ie. smart and educated.
Yet, that scene has her bending forward towards the camera many times
to show her cleavage in an attempt to sexualize her despite her small
breasts.In the end, not worth a full-price movie ticket to see it in the
theater. A DVD rental at most, fast-forwarded through the dull, slow
scenes for sure.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Shameless money grab that is sub-par at best<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Let me preface by saying that while the &#x27;91 cartoon is my favorite
movie of all time, I am not a strict cartoon purist, as the Broadway
musical of BATB is also one of my favorites and there are other takes
on the fairy tale that I really enjoy as well. But, when you are doing
the songs from the cartoon and even replicate some scenes
shot-for-shot, I expect that the characters should feel familiar and
the quality of the production should live up to its predecessor.
Unfortunately, this 2017 version falls dreadfully short. CASTING - The biggest blunder is Emma Watson in the lead role. This is
not to disparage her as an actress in general, but she is not right for
this. Her Belle lacks grace, enthusiasm, warmth and sincerity. She
seems bored, and while it sounds like she could have quite a sweet
voice with further training, it is evident she does not have that skill
set yet. In the other title role, Dan Stevens&#x27; Beast is all CGI and you
never forget it. They&#x27;ve also edited his voice to make him sound more
&#x22;beastly&#x22;, which makes his solo awkward to listen to. One has to wonder
why they didn&#x27;t just cast someone with a deeper voice then? The
character also seems a more like a grumpy old man than a tortured soul
in a beastly body. Why did Disney cast &#x22;Hollywood names&#x22; instead of
people who were best for the role? It&#x27;s not like there was ever a doubt
this would be a box office smash anyway given the beloved source
material. I also never believed for a moment the relationship between
any of the characters with the exception of the playful
rivalry/camaraderie between Cogsworth &#x26; Lumiere. CGI AND MUSIC - For a &#x22;live action&#x22; version, it certainly feels more
stilted and unreal. The CGI in general looks fake, and the enchanted
objects are creepy. There are new songs but they are mostly dull. Now,
I think Alan Menken is a musical genius, so perhaps it had something to
do with having to write songs for non- singers. The Beast&#x27;s new song is
the best of the bunch, but the emotion doesn&#x27;t seem appropriate for the
scene. The reused songs have new arrangements &#x26; new lyrics, but with
the exception of The Mob Song, the changes are distracting and feel
oddly paced. STORYLINE - In truth, the whole movie is oddly paced. Things are
dragged out that don&#x27;t need to be, and other things zoom by that should
have been fleshed out. They give backstories, but odd ones at odd times
in odd ways. Minor spoilers: For example, Gaston is a soldier who saved
the village and that&#x27;s why everyone loves him. He likes Belle for her
looks but also her dignity.By giving the villagers a very good reason
to like him, he is no longer a foil for the Beast. Gaston is supposed
to be handsome, strong and charismatic and people equate that with
being good. The Beast is ugly so they automatically think he&#x27;s bad. Is
not the moral that it&#x27;s actually what&#x27;s on the inside that counts? It
seems they have forgotten the point. Even Belle makes a joke in poor
taste at the end which undermines the message. Furthermore, significant
details are altered which result in the Beast not changing &#x26; the leads
basically falling in love by accident, and (SPOILER) the enchanted rose
has no real significance in the end (END SPOILER) I could say more, but I think you get the picture. I wanted to like it,
but it grossly failed to enchant.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Skip this movie. You won&#x27;t miss anything<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Skip this movie. You won&#x27;t miss anything. Except perhaps the good
performance by Luke Evans as Gaston. But still, the bad aspects of this
film just overrides any good ones.There were too many distractions in the film that it does not evolve
into a movie experience. There are lots of propaganda in this film. If
you would like to put racial minority actors, you don&#x27;t pick 18th
century France as your setting. I am a racial minority so I can say
this. They also depict that gays as mostly men in drag, weak and the so
called gay scenes are not empowering at all but rather tacky. I am gay,
so I have a right to say this.The worst distraction and aspect of this film is Emma Watson. She
doesn&#x27;t give justice to the role of Belle. You can see it in her eyes.
This actress grew up with everything, having played Hermione. Belle is
a sweet, innocent provincial lass. Every time I look at Emma Watson, it
seems like I am waiting for her to roll her eyeballs or take out a
cellphone and tweet.Dan Stevens looked effeminate and his beast form should have been a
bird and not a mammal. Josh Gad looked mechanical, uninspired and
unconvincing as gay LeFou. I watched this film because I was afraid I would miss out on something
historic or a good film sequence. But sadly there was none. I should
have skipped this.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Flat<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Wow. Where to begin? I really wondered why the studio spent so much on
pre opening publicity. Had they done nothing, sales would be enormous.
I expected so much more from Watson. She may have done better with la
la land. Had the studio not made so much of the homosexual pass no one
would have noticed. One commenter said she liked be our guest, the
musical number. I found it a strangely mishmash of the original movie
and some new stuff. It was horribly confusing. The best part is without
makeup Dan Stevens bears a striking resemblance to the picture of the
Prince in the original version.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Watch it for the nostalgia. Nothing else will make it worthwhile.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;ve seen better produced YouTube videos. I kept thinking the theater
had mistakenly played an early rough cut.The sound mixing was amateurish. At one point in an early song you
could barely hear, let alone understand, the words of the main singer
because the orchestral music was overpowering it. All throughout the
movie the mixing sounded very uneven to me.Luke Evans did not make a good Gaston. I&#x27;ve liked him in other movies
but in this one his acting was more boorish than his character.The effects for the non-human characters (except the Beast) were
horrendous. It reminded me of the animation in the old Christmas shows
like Rudolph the Reindeer, the Misfit Toys, Frosty the Snowman, etc.
The effects were bad enough to be distracting (especially Mrs. Potts
and Chip).If your only reason for seeing this film is for the effects, do
yourself a favor and skip it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just OK....<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Some good production design aside, this is a boring rendition of the
classic fairy tale. Do yourself a favor and watch Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1946
French version. This is really a comment that I would normally post on the message
boards, but somebody got rid of them :(
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Underwhelming - some lovely scenes but the CGI face of Beast is a constant distraction<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Up front: I&#x27;m probably not the right audience for this film. I only
went because I was invited, and I wouldn&#x27;t have gone to check this one
out otherwise. Firstly, some of the production values are really beautiful and
reminded me of the animated classic in a good way. Also, the voice cast
for the clock and the kitchen devices are great.Secondly, the actors, well... this may sound kind of harsh, but I&#x27;ve
never seen Emma Watson act so stiff in a movie. Her performance is
wooden, which is pretty bad considering she&#x27;s supposed to be the heart
of the film. Also, she probably won&#x27;t start a singing career anytime
soon.Thirdly (and most importantly), Beast. That&#x27;s where they really dropped
the ball. Giving him a lifeless CGI face was an unforgivable mistake,
and it&#x27;s such a constant distraction that I could never really get into
the movie.Overall, I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this movie, at least not to
adults. I&#x27;m sure most kids would enjoy it though, and it&#x27;s not really a
bad film: just a very mediocre one. 6 stars out of 10.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Expensive but not expansive...everything money can buy or manufacture except charm and spirit<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney trying to top themselves. This live-action rendering of the
studio&#x27;s 1991 animated version of the oft-told fairy tale is Disney&#x27;s
way of giving family-friendly audiences a &#x27;treat&#x27; while raking in big
money the easy way: by delivery a presold product, one with name and
song value--and built-in approval ratings. At a debutante ball in 18th
century France, an old hag casts a spell on the partygoers after she is
rebuffed (seems she&#x27;s an enchantress in disguise, though we have no
idea why); the selfish prince of the manor is then turned into a
beastly creature, while his attendants are turned into (talking)
objects. Her spell will be broken once the prince learns about true
love, though this must happen before the last pedal on the
enchantress&#x27;s rose falls... Ideally, this material is timeless and
should entertain those who do not know the story and approach it with a
fresh perspective. However, while Disney&#x27;s previous version broke new
ground for animated musicals, this dark, lead-footed endeavor never
lifts off, remaining flatly earthbound despite the familiar songs and
characters. When trying for a little humor, scenarists Stephen Chbosky
and Evan Spiliotopoulos cannot come up with anything other than dry
sarcasm, which doesn&#x27;t wear well on their princess Belle, played by a
miscast Emma Watson. Whether feigning indignation or attempting to
register awe, Watson approaches her part with a firm jaw and a
righteous tone, as if this were a feminist mock-up; when she asks the
Beast if he&#x27;s joking when he offers his castle to her, she sounds like
the captain of a cheerleading squad. The art direction and design of
this preconceived blockbuster is fussy and forgettable--no one will
come out of this movie saying that it transported them to another time
and place--while the unobtrusive supporting cast plays it safe, perhaps
so as not to be in competition with their animated counterparts.
Somewhere, French filmmaker Jean Cocteau (who helmed the 1946 version,
&#x22;La Belle et la B&#xEA;te&#x22;) is smiling, for trendy blockbusters come and go
but art remains truly timeless. *1/2 from ****

(Spoilers ahead, possibly)As much as I love Disney, shame on them for insisting on modernizing
classic animated movies by making live-action remakes. From the moment
I heard of this movie being in production, a part of me knew that it
would never measure up to the beloved 1991 film, yet try to compensate
for this fact with some *grand* musical numbers and better developed
elements of the story and characters...This movie, in my opinion, is just okay, and I would not mind never
watching it after that first viewing (save for a few scenes toward the
end). In my opinion, B&#x26;tB tries a bit too hard to impress viewers of a
new generation (predictable), and the use of auto-tune on the female
lead was annoying and unnecessary (none of that that rubbish, or cast
an actress who can actually sing well!) The new songs enhance the story
but are altogether unmemorable. The live-action versions of Mrs. Potts
and the rest of the enchanted objects looked so dainty and realistic,
it was creepy and &#x22;unmagical&#x22; to me. As for the main characters, the
writers did not even seem to give Gaston a chance. He was deeply
unlikable from the beginning, so his characterization was not very
well-rounded in this version (villains deserve even a bit of
love/empathy).There are enough remakes/reboots being made nowadays, and I find it
upsetting that Disney ended up tampering with one of its classics. This
movie is a bit of a disappointment. Listen to the other reviewers
stating you would be better off re-watching the original.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>How Disappointing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Just because you can, doesn&#x27;t mean you should.&#x22; I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t be the last time I say this, but it needs to be
said: Stop making movie musicals with people who can&#x27;t sing. If they
can&#x27;t sing, drop the Autotunes and dub them. We have the technology;
it&#x27;s virtually painless. Non-singing actors have ruined 3 of my
favorite musicals: Beauty &#x26; the Beast, Sweeney Todd, and Phantom of the
Opera. In a musical, music is a character, and hearing Josh Groban sing
&#x22;Evermore&#x22; over the end credits merely proved what was missing. The overuse of CGI in films is creating a nightmare of quick cut, in
your face visuals that are detracting from the overall story and quite
frankly, giving me a headache. Again, CGI should enhance, not overtake
your scenes and wrestle them and your actors into the ground. The same
CGI that made &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; a thing of beauty in the 1991 version
creates an on-screen, muddled mess here. In fact, the CGI detracted
rather than enhanced this entire production. The cartoon characters
showed more emotion than the flat, emotionless, and rather frightening
faces here. I&#x27;d rather not comment on the acting because it&#x27;s hard to do that and
not hurt people&#x27;s feelings, and at the end of the day, actors are
people, too. I will say that there is a reason Disney is now seriously
recognizing and marketing their Villains. THEY ROCK. Oh, and Kevin
Kline gets a pass because I love him. :-) While others may love it, it simply wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I wanted to like the live action version<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really wanted to like the live action version of Beauty and the
Beast. I was obsessed with the animated version growing up as a kid. I
went to see it in theaters on New Year&#x27;s 1991. My main complaint is
that I believe Belle was miscast. I like Emma Watson, but I think the
character of Belle would have been portrayed better by someone who is
less known, or who is not mostly known from playing one character. Another thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the film is supposed to be live
action but everything about the film is so over produced that nothing
seems real. The parts that were added or changed that moved away from the original
were boring and didn&#x27;t convey the spirit that the original had. It&#x27;s hard to make some aspects of the film live action (Chip, Mrs.
Potts, etc.) however Lumiere and Cogsworth were downright creepy.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Very disappointing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First I want to say that I have been waiting for too many years hoping
that Disney will make my favorite Cartoons in real movies; but when I
went to the movies and I saw beauty and the beast I was very
disappointed.I expected to see something beautiful, like the work they
did with Cinderella. Why they didn&#x27;t chose the same director. This
movie would have been huge!. I was sad. My little daughter was scared
of the beast. She is 7 years old and kept crying. This is supposed to
be a family movie. This movie didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all.
Actors didn&#x27;t show emotion while acting. It looks fake. I&#x27;m sorry; but
it was disappointing.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Wholly, and entirely underwhelming<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The original was a part of my childhood so I was excited for this movie
ever since I heard about it. I did have some concerns though. Concerns
that were present in every minute of this movie. A disappointment but
the thing that I was most surprised by was there was no heart. Good
actors and very little chemistry hurt this movie. However it will still
make a billion dollars so I&#x27;m sure Disney will be fine. Disney is
kicking so much butt that even their bad movies destroy at the box
office.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Ruined by the female lead<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This had all the hallmarks of a great live action fantasy epic.
Brilliant visuals and great effects, a half decent story with some
interesting characters, and of course, it&#x27;s Disney. What could possibly
go wrong?2 words, Emma Watson.I know Ms Watson has legions of fans who&#x27;ll watch anything she is in
just because of her Harry Potter connections but almost everything I
see her in, she ruins. She has the acting range of a wooden block, her
delivery is so stilted here, that it completely takes you out of the
film and her facial expressions never seem to change. Seriously, she
could have been wearing a mask in this and you wouldn&#x27;t have been able
to tell any difference, she just stares blankly and looks disinterested
for the whole film. She&#x27;s awful as Belle and her dialogue delivery is
cringe inducing. I lost count of the amount of times I rolled my eyes
when she tried to convey any emotion, it was embarrassing.Now, I&#x27;m not trying to simply beat up Emma Watson because I dislike
her, it isn&#x27;t that at all, but when someone in a film is so bad they
make the film almost impossible to enjoy, it really needs to be pointed
out.This could have been a great fantasy epic but I myself couldn&#x27;t wait
for it to end. Shame really, had they have cast an actress with a
morsal of talent or acting skill, this could have been really good.Stick to the original animated film, it&#x27;s far better.No doubt it will still make tons of cash though.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>No comparison to the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Emma Watson should not have been cast as Belle, first of all she is far
from being a beauty she is average looking not to mention she has no
singing experience. Emmy Rossum who is both a beauty and a fantastic
singer should have been cast as Belle, she actually looks like her. The
casting is ridiculous, her voice is sub par and does no credit to the
original movie, im going to pretend this remake doesn&#x27;t exist, the
casting of Gaston was also absurd....not to mention the adding of
strange dialogue that is not even in the original movie, the whole
casting was ridiculous but Emma Watson does no credit to Belle and is
one of the biggest casting mistakes ever made! my favourite fairy tale
but not movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Thank you for ruining a great movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
OK, I really love the animated movie so I was hoping so much it will be
great live action. Even I didn&#x27;t watch the trailer because I wanted to
be surprised. But then, I&#x27;m so disappointed.First, why they changed Ms. Pott nose? That&#x27;s her characteristic. Two,
why they need to add stories. The prince&#x27;s parents story is fine
because I&#x27;ve been wondering about his parents before. But Belle&#x27;s
mother and reason why her father didn&#x27;t talked about her mother? Not
really.. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to tell people that for all this
time her father not talking about her mother to her. Three, why need to
change the stories? Her father being left in the woods? Belle and her
father not being saved by Chip and their washing machine? And the last
battle? People vs living furniture is my fave scene because it&#x27;s so
epic and in this film it&#x27;s just &#x22;that&#x27;s it?&#x22; and why need to change the
&#x27;cute Beast playing with bird in the snow&#x27; with &#x27;playing with horse&#x27;?
And last, Belle&#x27;s changes. Belle is so beautiful and elegant, brave but
gentle. In here, they changed her to not be woman enough. I know they
wanted Belle looked strong but why need to remove her elegance? What&#x27;s
her doing with her skirt? Belle&#x27;s dress is classic but in here it&#x27;s so
simple. It&#x27;s gold not yellow. And oh my, Emma Watson really RUINED
Belle by her acting. No emotion at all. Did she want to challenge
Kristen Stewart with &#x27;no emotion&#x27; acting? And why she&#x27;s still using
British accent? This movie background is in France. If Belle&#x27;s British,
where&#x27;s her father&#x27;s accent?Oh I&#x27;m so angry, they ruined my childhood movie. I have another few
complaints but I already said much. The best of this movie is only
Lumiere that&#x27;s why I still gave 3/10.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Overstuffed and lacks the charm of the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was really looking forward to this film. Not only has Disney recently
made excellent live-action versions of their animated masterpieces
(Jungle Book, Cinderella), but the cast alone (Emma Watson, Ian
McKellen, Kevin Kline) already seemed to make this one a sure hit.
Well, not so much as it turns out.Some of the animation is fantastic, but because characters like
Cogsworth (the clock), Lumi&#xE8;re (the candelabra) and Chip (the little
tea cup) now look &#x22;realistic&#x22;, they lose a lot of their animated
predecessors&#x27; charm and actually even look kind of creepy at times. And
ironically - unlike in the animated original - in this new realistic
version they only have very limited facial expressions (which is a
creative decision I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand). Even when it works: there can be too much of a good thing. The film is
overstuffed with lush production design and cgi (which is often weirdly
artificial looking though) but sadly lacking in charm and genuine
emotion. If this were a music album, I&#x27;d say it is &#x22;over-produced&#x22; and
in need of more soul and swing. The great voice talent in some cases
actually seems wasted, because it drowns in a sea of visual effects
that numbs all senses. The most crucial thing that didn&#x27;t work for me,
though, is the Beast. He just never looks convincing. The eyes somehow
don&#x27;t look like real eyes and they&#x27;re always slightly off.On the positive side, I really liked Gaston, and the actor who played
him, Luke Evans, actually gave the perhaps most energized performance
of all. Kevin Kline as Belle&#x27;s father has little to do but to look
fatherly and old, but he makes the most of his part. Speaking of Belle,
now that I&#x27;ve seen the film, I think her role was miscast. I think
someone like Rachel McAdams would actually have been a more natural,
lively and perhaps a bit more feisty Belle than Emma Watson. If you love the original, you might want to give this one a pass, it&#x27;s
really not that good (although at least the songs were OK). Also, I&#x27;d
think twice before bringing small children; without cute animated
faces, all those &#x22;realistic&#x22; looking creatures and devices can be
rather frightening for a child.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>everything wrong with this movie (note: just my opinion)<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I went into the movie expecting an uninspired, yet beautifully animated
movie that is exactly like the old animated one, just remade as a life
action. Nothing exceptional, but nice to look at and maybe to get a bit
nostalgic. If you expect that, you can forget it.What i got was: Strange CGI: the characters, especially the servants
looked plastic and almost creepy.Some new information about the characters background stories (Belle&#x27;s
Mom) that were nice but didn&#x27;t go into dept at all.Old scenes remade, often they took all the atmosphere out of them,
(like in the final battle, remember how epic it was, it rained and
Gaston hit that statue while trying to find beast, and beast was moving
around like a shadow, in the new version it lacks the suspense)Bad singing technique: It often sounded rushed, emotionless and too
serious. Also auto-tuned :((( is it so hard to get experienced singers
that you need to make the computer do the trick? I was prepared not to
be overjudgemental, but as the first singer opened their mouth, all I
could do was shake my head. That is not good quality. (I am referring
to the German cast)Rushed moments and sloppy dialogue,Bad humour: Some jokes were funny, but most of the time I was like,
&#x22;that was the most stupid thing I heard today, oh wait, it just got
topped&#x22;Emma Watson, who could kill a bear with her bare hands in a movie and
I&#x27;d believe it, but her longing look at the end and her being a dreamy
person... I don&#x27;t buy it.This was my impression, but hey, we all have different views on the
world, so check it for yourself, if you don&#x27;t believe me :psomething positive at the end: I liked LeFou, this actor was a great
choice.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappointed<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Had high hopes for this film since it was my fave as a child plus with
it being a timeless classic. Came out with mixed views. I thought the
overall cast seemed forced and a bit bland for the most part and
generally didn&#x27;t do the original characters justice from a personality
side of things, I was really hoping to see Cogsworth and Lumiere bicker
with each other a lot more as I remember in the Animation. Overall
acting and singing of all was OK throughout but lacking convincing
emotion. My favourite character was Gastarn . The sequences of scenes were jumpy and didn&#x27;t blend very well and
script was word from word to the original which was OK but it couldn&#x27;t
have hurt to add a few extras to make it more fluid and natural. Overall like others have said it could have been a big success but
personally I&#x27;d stick to the original.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Nice to look at, and listen to, but not engaging<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Frankly, this new live-action version of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; was one
of the bigger disappointments in recent memory, eclipsed only by how
much I disliked &#x22;Kong: Skull Island&#x22; just last week. There is so much
apparent hard work showing on screen and audibly, with gorgeous
costumes and a beautifully-orchestrated and performed musical score
(the orchestra&#x27;s part in it), but it barely registered for me as an
engaging, exciting, vibrant, or touching film--the exact opposite of
the pure, exhilarating joy that was the all-animated &#x22;Beauty and the
Beast&#x22; this is being compared to. I love musicals, have since I was a
kid, and paid extra to see this new live-action version in a
large-format theater known for great sound and picture near me--and it
was a huge waste of money at nearly $15 a ticket. I found myself
studying the costuming and just listening to the orchestral score to
pass the time, and lamenting the CGI-animated Beast&#x27;s walks, leaps, and
dancing, as it was so herky-jerky it felt like old stop-motion
animation throughout (which, ironically, was somehow more effective in
its obviousness). There is so much more to complain about, but I&#x27;ll
stop here--just know that I wanted to love this film, wanted to be
transported the way musicals sometimes do transport audiences so well,
and ended up fidgety and bored, checking my watch to see how much
longer it could possibly be.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappointed.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast is by far one of my most favourite movies. The
story it portrays, the music and magic and morals knowing that love
heals all, unfortunately, I only saw and felt all that from the
animated version and not this one. This movie lacked the good old &#x22;warm
and fuzzy&#x22; feeling you get from Disney&#x27;s animated movies, it lacked
&#x22;heart.&#x22; It just seemed a little emotionless and forced, some bits even
seem rushed, other parts had nothing to do with the original at all. I
was looking forward to see how Beast would be as a &#x22;realistic&#x22; version
but they didn&#x27;t capture Beast&#x27;s imagery or personality at all and I
feel the same way about Emma Watson playing &#x22;Belle&#x22; I like Emma Watson,
she is a great actress but she is no &#x22;Belle.&#x22; I wanted to like this
movie and I was hoping for the same satisfaction as I got from the
animation, but I couldn&#x27;t. I have been a Disney fan all my life but I
think Disney should have left this one alone, sorry but the animation
was better.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Changes make it less feminist, sorry<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I am going to say it. For all Disney&#x27;s recent &#x22;updates&#x22; they have not
quite figured how to actually write a feminist love story. The older
ones were better, and the strength of their females was allowed to
speed for itself. The old 1991 film is much better in this area. In this one, it is stated that Belle will need to marry a man who can
provide for her when her father dies, something that is not in the
original film. This actually happened to female intellectuals of that
era. They could be smart, but could never use their intelligence to
help provide for their family. Nannerl Mozart was supposedly as
talented as her brother Wolfgang, but had to quit performing once she
married. So, Belle still has to marry a rich man to help her. There was that Maleficent film several years ago,where the three strong
female characters, the fairies, where transformed into bumbling idiots.
And in the original film, aurora&#x27;s parents showed true love by sending
her away for 16 years, and not see her for her own safety. Which was
probably extra difficult for them since she lived just outside the
village.in the &#x22;feminist&#x22; one, her mom dies and dad is a villain. Somehow, the newer &#x22;feminist&#x22; updated films have seemed to make their
female characters weaker. They can include songs in their films poking
fun at true loves kiss and love at first sight and keep the princess
single all they want to, but it means nothing&#x27;s if they can&#x27;t actually
figure out how to make the princess wife, mom, provider, Queen, etc. And don&#x27;t get me started on how mean he is to bell up until she is
attacked by the wolves. And none of the castle servants family can help
them break the curse? Please! And be our guest was not nearly flashy
enough. Gastons character seemed inconsistent, and monsieur d arque
wasn&#x27;t creepy enough.The old songs felt crammed in there too. I have seen the Broadway show
3 times.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Met my expectations...and that&#x27;s not a good thing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I didn&#x27;t want to see this movie because I felt it was going to be an
exact play by play of the 1991 animated film. And I was right. It was a
live action version of the animated film done exactly the same way.
Nothing changed and what was added was completely forgettable and I
just didn&#x27;t care. I like Emma Watson but in this her acting felt forced
and I think she was miscast. I didn&#x27;t buy that she was in love with the
beast and I didn&#x27;t buy that the beast was in love with her. Speaking of
which the CGI for the beast and everything else I thought was just
horrible, cringe worthy, and distracting.The beast was not a beast at all and what I mean by that is I wasn&#x27;t
frightened or disturbed, he even had a musical number that I also
thought was cringe worthy. The beast in the animated version was
beastly, terrifying, stubborn and you hated him, so it was great
watching him transition and change into a softer gentler beast.I did like moments like seeing how the castle curse effected not only
the beast but how it effected the staff and so forth. Every time a rose
petal fell the characters slowly became more and more like antiques so
I felt somewhat sympathetic.The music and the score were also good but other than that there&#x27;s
nothing else I can really say about this movie. Its not memorable I
wouldn&#x27;t watch it twice. Its the same exact movie just go watch the
animated version its leagues better.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Many misses<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The director hit the targets he was aiming for, it&#x27;s disappointing that
a quality film was not on the list. It seems the movie just assumes
that you will care about the characters. I found very little to like in
the character development. The times where the creators thought he was
driving home a successful point the scene stinks of silly politics and
I heard giggles throughout the theater. A bright spot was beast&#x27;s sad
solo which was a great (albeit unintended) comic touch. I am pretty
confused about the higher ratings online. As a lifelong Disney fan I
really can&#x27;t think of a more poorly made Disney movie. To be fair the
visuals were absolutely stunning, visually this was a real treat. I
very much appreciated the that the set was stylized to perfection. It&#x27;s
very ironic that there is such a tip of the hat to reading when the
illiterate are perhaps the only ones that will truly appreciate this
poorly timed mess. The one save for the loss of my evening is that I
did now have expose my 4 year old girl to this mess.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>unremarkable, forgettable event overdone with no soul<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Never seen any previous version. So I get to give a unbiased view.The music is the worst turn off for this film, the lyrics were
instantly forgettable, the score was boring and the main leads voice
was far too over produced and stripped of the human aspects that really
carry a performance. It had nice costumes, the cgi was passable though I felt cheated at the
end when all the characters changing happened off camera - safe
option.. but boring.Acting was a little forced but fine, the pace felt OK.The overall feel of the movie was mildly entertaining.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Magnificent Computer Graphic Imagery and Cinematography<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; retells the Disney&#x27;s version of the French
fairy-tale written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and
published in 1740. The story is very similar to the magnificent 1991
animation and highly attractive. However this 2017 version is uneven,
with the most boring songs that anyone could imagine and reasonable
acting despite the great names in the cast. But the top-notch Computer
Graphic Imagery (CGI) and the cinematography are worthwhile watching.
Keep awake along the musical scenes and you may like and be surprised
by this version. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): &#x22;A Bela e a Fera&#x22; (&#x22;The Beauty and the Beast&#x22;)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Belle (Swan) and the Beast<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS It is really simple. If they wanted to make a good movie, a really good movie they would
take care of two things. 1. Belle. They would cast an actor who can
actually ...act.(After watching the movie it is pretty obvious that the only reason
Watson landed the role is her pretty big fan base of teenagers from her
Harry Potter films)What we needed for Belle&#x27;s role? Fresh, energetic, with a smile that lights her face actress. What we got? The twin sister of Bella Swan that landed herself in medieval France.
Seriously I was waiting for Edward Cullen to do a cameo from time to
time. Haven&#x27;t watched miss Watson in Harry Potter films but this was just a
disaster. 2. The Beast. It was so.... distressing to watch a soulless face throughout the movie
talking. Even at the peak of the Beast&#x27;s story when he lets Belle go,
and we suppose to see the agony, the pain, all I get is.... nothing.
Soulless. Flat. Disappointing.I am confused. Should the actor still work harder and deliver his role
as a beast better or it is due that horrible CGI head that we can&#x27;t
appreciate his performance? Either way, again, they could do a lot better. To sum this up, soulless Beast x miscast Belle leads to this awful
remake to a classic animated film that we all grew up to love. Save your money and go watch something else.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Do yourself a favor and just watch the animated version again<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It&#x27;s incredible how lifeless this live-action adaptation (with real,
breathing humans) is compared to the 1991 animated version. The efforts
to make the love story more believable were appreciated, but still fell
way short and the effort was barely there in terms of writing and
acting. The visuals were unimpressive at the least to downright ugly in
some. (A simple example would be the rose, just sadly trapped in glass,
not even glowing. Lifeless.) The musical pieces were bland, nothing
really special, like the commitment was just halfway, just something
they had to do. (Be Our Guest was especially disappointing: badly
designed, choreographed and directed that really, you would beg to just
watch the animated version again instead.) I would&#x27;ve cut some of those
additional songs as well. The singing, except for 6-time Tony Award
winner Audra McDonald, was mediocre. Autotune was definitely used for a
lot of them, but you can especially tell with lead Emma Watson. The
acting was also all over the place. Out of the actors we see on screen,
only Luke Evans really commits to his role, his best moments being in
the first half of the movie. Dan Stevens&#x27; performance is hard to
decipher, since his voice was heavily edited for Beast, and his face is
completely CGI. Also eye roll-worthy were the fake French accents some
voice actors had to use while others retain their own English accents,
and Mrs. Potts voiced by Emma Thompson had a cockney accent. Remember
that everyone is in France anyway. Either hire French actors or just
drop the &#x27;accent&#x27; entirely. This movie was nothing but a complete cash
grab for Disney, and the box office numbers will unfortunately let them
keep making movies this empty.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Very poor the performance of the cast<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
100% agree with Joshua Cimarric-Penczek. A super production wasted.
Emma Watson&#x27;s performance was very poor, failed to capture the audience
because she did not look naive, lovely and beautiful. She looks like a
robot in the movie. She did not generate emotions, even taking the most
important role of that beautiful novel. The film was rescued for the
excellent performance of Luke Evans (Gaston) and Josh Gad (LeFou). The
rest of the cast only served as fill in the plot.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>UN Women&#x27;s Goodwill Ambassador endorses domestic abuse.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Watching the UN Women Goodwill Ambassador rubber stamp the business
model of every dirt bag who sought to employ domestic abuse in order to
win the affections of a woman, was the final word on the dangers of
virtue signaling.I just sat through two hours of an outspoken advocate for women&#x27;s
rights expertly demonstrating the efficacy of the &#x22;Bad Boy&#x22; routine and
why so many men employ it. Let me summarize the remake of The Beauty and the Beast, spoiler alert.A strong and independent woman who doesn&#x27;t need a husband to be happy
or relevant is kidnapped by an emotionally damaged recluse with anger
issues. Initially she is repulsed and defiant, this behavior is unacceptable
and she is a strong, independent woman after all. He attempts to use his power to restrict her access to food in order to
to have her join him for dinner so he can begin to win her love, but
again she resists, for she is a strong, independent woman after all.As our heroine prepares to escape from this brute, another woman
explains to her that the Beast isn&#x27;t all bad, that his violent
tendencies and abusive behavior isn&#x27;t his fault you see, he just never
had a mother. It is at this moment that she arrives at the logical
conclusion that this beast needs saving, and that she is just the woman
to &#x22;fix&#x22; him.Shortly after this she is caught going through his closet (kinda) and
suffers a barrage of verbal abuse, rightly decides to leave, and
promptly does so by shouting that she won&#x27;t tolerate such behavior and
runs out the front door. (Which apparently she could have done at any
point during her &#x22;detention&#x22;).As she flees she is beset by a gang (of wolves) and valiantly tries to
fight them off, but is overpowered only to be saved by the very man she
was trying to escape. He savagely beats the assailants in order to
protect his property but is injured and succumbs to his wounds. As the
beast slips in and out of consciousness Belle begins to mount her horse
and flee, but his brutally primal show of affection has clearly
impressed her, and she not only CHOOSES to return to an abusive
relationship but she nurses him back to health.The abusive control freak shows Belle a softer side and demonstrates
his love with shiny things.After the Beast finally sets Belle free she returns to her village only
to insist that &#x22;they don&#x27;t know him like she does&#x22; and that he wouldn&#x27;t
really hurt anyone! They reunite, profess their love for each other and live happily ever
after.Two important lessons are learned from this adventure.Inside every strong independent woman is a little princess who needs
lots of material wealth and a strong paternalistic male to protect her,
andInside every violent and abusive man is a prince who just needs the
right woman to understand that the only reason he gets so mad is
because he loves her so much.Thank you Emma Watson for setting women back 100yrs.

The Plot. If you don&#x27;t know the plot, you have been living under a rock
for 40 years. So the direction is good. The look of the movie is good. The exposition
is good. The special effects are good. The acting is decent. But there
is something missing. You&#x27;ll leave the movie feeling empty. There is no
heart to this movie.It&#x27;s mechanical.And then there is the pandering like I&#x27;ve never seen. Over the top
flaming gay characters abound and every person of color is partnered
with a white person. What? They couldn&#x27;t find one set of blacks to be
partnered?It&#x27;s really offensive to our sensibilities because movies now have been
reduced to identity politics and quotas instead of making good movies.Disney must be spinning in his grave.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not as good as I expected<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I agree the picture is very pretty. But to be honest, this is a very
bad movie. The story do not give me any impression, I can&#x27;t tell why
Bell fall in love with monster, the only reason looks like he is very
rich because he has a big library. I almost sleep in the theater. Don&#x27;t
wast you money and time on it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappointing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I watched the original in early 90s , I watch it now again very often
with my 3 years daughter and enjoyed it again. The old version is
almost perfect and probably one of the best Animation movies ever made,
one of the best musicals and one of the best Disney movies. I went with
my daughter (who loves the original) to see this again and what did we
find ?!! A real disappointment !!! My daughter who watches and enjoys
the original at least once a week fall asleep after 1 hour. I felt a
headache of the unnecessary, unexpressive, low quality, excessive CGI
effects and My wife almost cried because of the horror done with this
classic.The movie has only 1 positive, which is adding the rose robbery scene
as that&#x27;s the real story in the traditional folk story. I can also say
that Luke Evans doesn&#x27;t look like Gaston but does well, Mc gregor , Ian
and Thompson do good acting when allowed. But otherwise, the movie was
very disappointing due to the following:&#x95; Emma Watson acting is fake and has nothing to do with Belle. She
doesn&#x27;t look smart, she is not feminine, she is rude with Gaston, she
looks like a kid &#x85;etc. &#x95; The beast has no expressions, it is not scary and is not tender &#x85; it
is nothing.&#x95; New songs are below the originals. So, why did we insert them?&#x95; Actors are not able to sing and do not improve the old songs.&#x95; The original had a lot of funny scenes for kids and adults. This one
has none unless throwing a big snow ball or putting make up on a beast
is considered funny !!!&#x95; Lumiere, Mrs pott, cogsworth, chip &#x85;etc. are not funny anymore, have
no expressions and cause headache when watching. While they were
Essential in the original movie.&#x95; The castle, the village &#x85;etc. all seem very fake for unknown reason
as they neither look like the original movie nor like real. So, why
didn&#x27;t we just shoot the movie in any village in the Alpes or Pyrinees
instead ?!!!!!&#x95; I am not racist, But the colored Librarian what is doing in France
when the movie is supposed to take place? And what about the library?
only 6 books ?!!! Then what did Belle read ?! always the same 6 books
?!!!! &#x95; What did the homosexual content add to the story? Are we promoting it
or defending it ?!! or is it supposed to be funny ?!!! I don&#x27;t
understand it.&#x95; What is the Paris thing about ?!! What did it add? My daughter got
asleep at that point !!!&#x95; How come the tree stroke by the thunder disappear ?! How does it snow
in June ?! How does it snow constantly in very limited terrain? Is this
movie supposed to be more serious than the original with real actors or
more childish or what?!! I don&#x27;t get it.&#x95; What is Maurice ? how come he sits in a table and starts eating
without being invited !! why ?!!! &#x95; Adult humor is missing: Lumiere &#x96; Don Juan Scenes, Gaston &#x96; Macho
scenes, Belle promoting Aladdin &#x85;etc.The movie is a failure, if you remake an excellent movie like this you
should have at least considered adding: excellent acting, new funny
scenes, improved songs, new better songs, dancing, choreography &#x85; etc.
but the movie didn&#x27;t.So, IN conclusion, this version is a very bad experience not worth its
budget or publicity. I have to watch the animation one with my daughter
almost every month because she adores it because the movie deserves
that. I am sure that with this version I will not face this problem.

I&#x27;m not a person who hates remakes and I understand why a lot of
studios are making remakes but at the same time, if you are going to
remake a movie DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT!One of the reasons I disliked this remake so much is that it tries a
few different things only to end up just copying the original. Are you
kidding me?Granted, the movie is visually stunning. The costumes in this movie are
gorgeous save for that godawful prom dress Watson wears during the ball
room scene. The scenery is also very lovely to look at and the CGI is
decent. The only issue I had with the CGI was Mrs. Potts. She was not
charming, she was creepy. Why couldn&#x27;t they make her look decent?
Everything else was fine save for her.Now if you have daughters who are dying to see this movie, then I could
suggest you go see it but that is it. The movie is rather dull. I think
that&#x27;s the major problem. Say what you want about the Cinderella remake
but it was fun, colorful and vivid. This remake has no love or light in
it. The only actors who seem to give a crap are Josh Gad, Luke Evans
and Ewan McGregor. The recent of the cast is trying their damnedest to
give decent performances. Like Stanley Tucci is trying and so is Gugu
Mbatha-Raw. Heck, even Audura McDonald is trying so hard to have fun
with the role she was given. It seems like a struggle for everyone.But the worst part of this movie is Emma &#x27;I&#x27;m a Fake Feminist&#x27; Watson.I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.Now I do think Emma was talented in the Harry Potter movies but it
suddenly seems like she has forgotten how to act. She shows literally
no emotion throughout this whole film. When she discovers that Lumiere
is walking and talking, she doesn&#x27;t look shocked. When the beast gets
shot by Gaston, still no emotion! Even when the Beast finally turns
into a human, she just has this stupid look on her face! Emma, SHOW
SOME GODDAMN EMOTION! YOU&#x27;RE AN ACTRESS, IT&#x27;S YOUR JOB! And then, she
tries to sing. Oh my god, even the auto tuning didn&#x27;t help! Never have
I heard such a flat voice!I know it sounds like I&#x27;m being harsh but this movie had been over
hyped since the director got his hands on it and I was just left
feeling underwhelmed with this whole thing. Wait for this remake to
come on Netflix, don&#x27;t waste your money.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not impressed<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This is my first ever review and I only took the time, because I had
been so disappointed by what I had seen, I thought I&#x27;d share my
experience. I took my partner and daughter to see this film as they are
both great fans of all things Disney, and I have seen the original
animated B&#x26;TB film myself many times before, and I had always enjoyed
it. When I came to see this, I had great expectations and paid good
money to watch it in IMAX 3D. What a terrible film! What has Disney
done! The entire CGI was rubbish, lifeless, and completely
underwhelming. Acting, especially by Emma Watson as Belle was dull and
uninspiring. Kevin Kline as Maurice was boring and unbelievable as
Belle&#x27;s father. Beast was non committal as erm... Beast. All the other
famous names were also wasted on this film. Only Luke Evans&#x27;s character
as Gaston stood out amongst the whole lot. All in all, not a must see
film but If you really must see this film, then don&#x27;t waste your money
like me on expensive tickets, and wait for it to come out on Sky Box
Office in a couple of Months, and so for under a fiver, you too can be
underwhelmed!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Mediocre Live Action Remake of a Disney Classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I will be the first person to acknowledge that remakes often can be a
necessary part of this industry. But this entire project just didn&#x27;t
sit well with me from the get-go. So let&#x27;s dive in, shall we?1) VOCALS:This was a musical, and as such being the case, it is inexcusable to
have Watson as the lead for such a classic. She never had vocal
coaching, and from the trailers alone this was clearly going to be CPU
corrected throughout to compensate.As predicted, her voice has been largely manipulated in post. And
considering that Walt Disney himself made such a big deal out of the
musical production in all of his movies, I cannot understand the
complete and total neglect of the soundtrack (again, something largely
responsible for what made the original so magical).2) CGI:Take a moment and go look at some pictures of CGI work in Life of Pi.
Then compare this to Beast&#x27;s face or any other animation in this
remake. I would then like you to ask yourself the following:How could it be that Life of Pi managed to create imagery of far
greater quality on a budget which was $40 million LESS than that which
Disney was working with.3) PRODUCTION &#x26; SET DESIGN:I liken this aspect to someone making everything out of cardboard and
then painting it in solid colors so as to exactly match the original.
Again, I do not understand why the set looked so lifeless considering
Disney has opted for a live-action remake. I couldn&#x27;t help but feel
this was lacking any form of originality with which to carry the movie.4) CASTING:Lucy Bevan was the casting director for this one. Some of her more
noteworthy credits include The Golden Compass, An Education, Nanny
McPhee Returns, Maleficent, 300, and Cinderella. It is quite clear
after taking a good look at her directorial resume just how hit-or-miss
this person is when it comes to choosing the right people for the right
roles.And once again, with such a strong backing for this film, I find myself
left dumbfounded wondering why Disney would take such a gamble with
arguably the greatest story to ever come out of the magic factory.ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS:This entire project just feels like it was overseen by an entirely new
group of execs and with no other intent other than the money. I
wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh, but this is Disney. An organization which prides
itself on utilizing fantastic music, strong performances, astounding
visuals, and detailed CGI. Yet every single one of those pillars has
been overlooked.I have no inherent problems with Watson. She has proved capable in one
of my favorites: The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012). However, this
role was not for her. This is one time where taking the risk (aka
learning to sing for the part) was a mistake. A task far too great for
her to overcome.If you are in your early teens, have young children, or are an avid fan
of Harry Potter, then this Disney remake is for you. The excitement of
seeing familiar characters on screen in real life will be excitement
enough, bringing about a sense of nostalgia long sought after.Simply put, this isn&#x27;t how films were meant to be created. Shame on you
Disney. It&#x27;s not OK for a company of such proportions to ignore
standards spanning nearly a century, instead demonstrating such blatant
disregard for the original.I give this 4 stars. There was nothing special about it. The problem
was that Disney chose to reboot a film which was already an 8/10 and
failed to bring about any hint of originality.Looking ahead, I really hope you don&#x27;t ruin Mulan and The Little
Mermaid with similar mistakes. We are currently 0/1. I will remain
optimistic, however, given the success of Cinderella. But for the love
of all that is good, Disney! PLEASE pull it together in upcoming
endeavors.A FINAL NOTE:For too long I have seen disingenuous reviews scattered throughout in
the opening weeks of any larger budget film release. This is really
starting to bother me IMDb! You guys should be able to create some sort
of list or set of requirements that must be fulfilled in order to leave
a review: for example, requiring users to have rated at least 500+
films, contributing to at least 3 different parts of this community, or
even just ensuring the account has no suspicious activity which would
be indicative of illegitimate, over the top reviews.There are of course going to be opposing views out there, however I
challenge those suspicious of unwarranted criticism like what I have
offered here to go and inspect the profiles to see which ratings are
associated with long-time active members. For this movie alone, nearly
half of all ratings over 8/10 come from accounts which were made just
weeks ago and whose activity consists of but one single rating for the
film. These falsified reviews are taking away from the validity of
overall IMDb ratings!Please, please, PLEASE do something about this :(----- 4/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----

Even as somebody who has still yet to see the original 1991 Beauty and
the Beast, something seems fishy to me about Bill Condon&#x27;s brand new
flesh and blood version. From the very first scene where our arrogant
prince (Dan Stevens) rejects the wrong witch and gets transformed into
a beast something rings inauthentic. It is as if this movie murdered
the original and is now wearing its skin, parading out in public as it
tries to convince everybody that it&#x27;s still the person they remember.
It&#x27;s all a bit scummy, really. Stop me if you&#x27;ve heard this one. Belle (Emma Watson) is the black
sheep bookworm of a small French village dreaming of bigger things.
When her father (Kevin Kline) goes missing, she discovers they he&#x27;s
been captured by the aforementioned beast and sacrifices herself so
that he can return home. Under the care of the beast and his group of
enchanted household applian - - wait&#x85;you have heard this one? OK, I&#x27;ll stop.The lifeblood of Beauty and the Beast ultimately lies in whether or not
the romance between Belle and her hairy liege ends up working. It&#x27;s a
relationship that&#x27;s been so normalized by pop culture but on paper,
it&#x27;s pretty strange stuff. That&#x27;s exactly how it comes across in this
version, strange. The beast&#x27;s transition from rabid rage machine to
kindly bookkeep feels entirely too rapid. We never see why Belle could
think of him as any more than a friend and a reluctant one at that,
considering that he, you know, kidnapped her. It certainly doesn&#x27;t help
that Watson is as dull as dishwater here. While she&#x27;s certainly proved
herself a more than capable actress in her post-Harry Potter career,
she seems terrified to inject her Belle with any personality that isn&#x27;t
written on the page. As such, she has little to no chemistry with
Stevens, who only fares a little bit better. While he certainly has the
screen presence and the deep, resonant voice that the beast requires,
his performance gets buried under an atrocious CGI design that never
feels the least bit intimidating. He looks like he&#x27;d be more at home in
Land of the Lost than $160 million dollar movie. Fortunately, the supporting cast is much stronger. Luke Evans is having
the time of his life as the bravado fueled Gaston, who is only
bolstered by genuinely hilarious interplay with Josh Gad&#x27;s LeFou. When
these two are on screen, we see hints of the boisterous musical
extravaganza this movie could have been if it wasn&#x27;t so concerned with
being somber whenever Belle and the Beast are on screen. Ewan McGregor
and Ian McKellen are also quite a bit of fun as Cogsworth and Lumiere,
even if McGregor is constantly fighting against an atrocious French
accent. Although, it&#x27;s hard to fault him for trying, which is more than
I can say for the rest of the cast. Seriously, if French actors are on
the Hollywood blacklist, can we just set the next &#x22;French&#x22; musical in
England? Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) certainly knows his way around a musical. The
numbers here are elaborately choreographed and well sung for the most
part. Each song establishes its own unique aesthetic, from Gaston&#x27;s
bouncy barroom to Be Our Guest&#x27;s Bollywood esque light-show. Condon&#x27;s
camera captures most of the action in wide takes, even if some of the
editing is a little fast. However, the pacing of the musical numbers is
thrown off with the addition of four new songs, all of which are rather
melancholy and bland. Unfortunately for Condon, this may be the ugliest looking big budget
movie on the market. The character design, in particular, is borderline
terrifying at times. They possess none of the vibrance and charm of the
original animated versions, proving that some characters just don&#x27;t
translate to live action. Watching a real life candlestick with a face
bounce around the screen is consistently off-putting, establishing a
constant sense of disconnection from the characters even when the
writing occasionally brings some charm out of them. While Beauty and the Beast is slavishly devoted to the film it is
trying to emulate, it still feels like a tonally confused mess. It
bounces back and forth from a dour romance to an enjoyable romp and
ultimately undercuts both. While there is certainly potential for these
Disney live action remakes to be worthwhile, they&#x27;re going to need to
veer more in the direction of Jon Favreau&#x27;s adaption of The Jungle
Book. That film was bold enough to create its own version of the story
while still recapturing the essence of the original. Meanwhile,
Condon&#x27;s film is limply crafted and terrified of taking risks. It&#x27;s a
tale as trite as time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Okay so I don&#x27;t ever do reviews. But I couldn&#x27;t keep my mouth shut with this one.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Here you have one of Disney&#x27;s most well loved and most successful
masterpieces. To a lot of people, THE most loved. So how can you go wrong with this one, right Disney? That&#x27;s what I thought at first. Then they announced the two main leads;
Emma Watson as Belle, and Dan Stevens as the Beast. Come again? How on
earth could Disney have got this so wrong? Who the heck was in charge
of casting?For the two main stars of the show, Belle and the Beast, you need
STRONG leads. Emma Watson just got lucky being cast in Harry Potter. Is
she one of the most talented actresses out there? No. Can she give us
the same emotion Belle shows that we all grew up loving? No. Can she
sing? Apparently not, because all I heard was this terrible auto-tuned
voice in every song she sang. And it wasn&#x27;t subtle either. What the
heck Disney! Just because Emma grew up in Paris didn&#x27;t make her &#x27;the
perfect Belle.&#x27;Dan Stevens. I liked him in Downton Abbey. However, I would never in a
million years thought to myself; &#x22;He&#x27;d make a great live-action Beast.&#x22;
Never! And oh gosh, his tacky CGI animation was just as bad as Emma&#x27;s
awful auto tuned voice. A big, CGI goat-man.Also, age difference much? The kiss that they finally shared at the end
was awkward, almost cringy, because Emma Watson looks like a teenage
girl, kissing her nearly-middle aged school teacher or something. It
was just weird.How could you screw this up Disney? You had the money! Just, why?! The
two main characters did nothing for me. I liked Belle&#x27;s costumes more
than I liked Belle. What does that say? Her clothes had more emotion?Why was Belle viewed as &#x27;odd&#x27; in her village full of weird characters?
Bonjour was waaay too over the top. Tale As Old As Time was too cockney. It may as well have been Mrs
Lovett from Sweeney Todd singing it.Also, Be Our Guest? How could you screw up Be Our Guest for crying out
loud? Well Disney did that too. Great job guys.Gaston. Is it only me who thought that the Villain stole the show?
Because Luke Evens did for me. He was awesome. When they had first cast
Luke Evens, I had a lot of doubts, but as I watched him on screen,
actually SINGING (he can sing) and dancing and having fun with his
role, I was sorry for ever doubting him. He and Josh Gad breathed life
into the songs we already loved from the original. I loved their
(slightly one sided) bromance.I was hoping LaFou would be more &#x27;animated&#x27; like he was in the
original, because I thought Josh Gad was perfect for this role, but I
still enjoyed him as a more real, toned down version.Best things about this movie: The costumes. (I chocked up when I saw
that yellow dress.) The score. (NOT the singing.) The cinematography.
(Minus all the unnecessary CGI) The choreography. Gaston and LeFou.
Lumi&#xE8;re&#x27;s cute relationship with Plumette.Okay I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s gonna take at least a week for me to get over this.
Maybe I&#x27;ll watch the original this weekend.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Tale as old as time - and still you can screw it up.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First I&#x27;ll explain the 4/10 stars; an attempt was made with this movie.
I could see the effort, but even if you make a cake and it looks pretty
it doesn&#x27;t matter if it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything.So yeah, I&#x27;m one of those who got disappointed with this remake. I had
read the reviews and seen the trailers, so I somewhat knew what I was
stepping in to when I went to see this.I&#x27;m very much with the audience that has already stated the obvious;
Emma Watson is lovely lady, but she&#x27;s no Belle. I get that the writers
wanted her to have some spunk in her rather than just be a bland miss
goody-two-shoes, but Watson can&#x27;t play it through. Just in one or two
scenes she looks like she&#x27;s about to grasp her role, other times she
looks like she&#x27;s just reading her lines out loud to her grandma. But
it&#x27;s not all her fault, the pointing finger goes almost entirely on
casting and the director. I mean - what&#x27;s with the awkward scenes? When
the Beast is fighting off Gaston, the camera suddenly shows Emma
gasping very theatrically. Like someone just shouts at her &#x22;Okay Emma,
now gasp like you&#x27;re in a school play and you have to make it show all
the way to the back row&#x22; - which she does, and it just looks silly.I mean.. There&#x27;s so much wrong in a movie that should&#x27;ve been the best
thing come out from Disney in ages. from start to finish this movie was
pain to watch. All the awkward ball scenes in the beginning and end,
well, at least the movie got to finish at the same dull feeling as it
started.There were good things, too. Like the design of the castle. Dan Stevens
singing his piece, which was nicely put together even though it wasn&#x27;t
a part of the original animation. The movie showed the Beasts&#x27; pain far
better than animated version. We get to see the more dark side of
Gaston&#x27;s personality.I will never watch this again, this I will assure you. I&#x27;m sorry, Sir
Ian McKellen, but even you couldn&#x27;t save this movie - as magnificent as
you are.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Much inferior to the cartoon version<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
If you watched the original cartoon version then you don&#x27;t want to
watch this one. All the characters, literally, are a washed down
version of the cartoon ones. It gets super boring when you realize the
script is almost 98% the same, despite hoping to see anything new and
fresh, or thought provoking (only a single one of these for me in the
whole movie). Feels more like a musical, which if I knew I wouldn&#x27;t
have gone to watch it. Real disappointment. Time wasted, ticket money
lost.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>pile of steaming crap<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The movie is bad. My now grown kids went with the wife and I. Kids wife
and I loved the cartoon version some 25 plus years back. This movie
don&#x27;t compare in any way. Kids are also life long Harry Potter fans and
thought they loved Emma Watson they went truly wishing to love this
movie they left feeling there money was stolen and swearing off Disney.
I felt I was stuck on a 2 hour lecture about the greatness of being a
liberal and found the movie sickening. Hey to each there own but I wish
never wasted a penny on this movie and I am a life long cartoon and kid
movie fan.QUOTE Yours: What THE f00k. what a pile of steaming crap.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Miscast of Belle, bad acting is distracting<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I wish they had chosen a real actress to portrait Belle - not just
someone who is there only because she is famous. I wish I had seen an
actress who has talent and can actually act, sing and show emotion and
some effort into the role.The original movie was amazing, and it has always been one of my
favorite Disney movies! Disappointed.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The animated film is better<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
What a shame that Disney missed the mark by so much on this. The
animated film and the stage production both are wonderful but this live
action remake is slow, stodgy and just plan boring. They assigned parts
to actors who didn&#x27;t have the range to sing them correctly and used
effects that were only impressive if you keep one eye shut.The much-publicized gay moment hardly registers so I would not keep
your children from this film on that account. The sad thing is that
several really good songs have been left out and the French period
they&#x27;ve chosen to portray is one of such extreme fashion that the
people don&#x27;t even look real. Smaller children will be very confused.I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time or money to see this at the theater, and if
you already have, well, that&#x27;s two hours you&#x27;ll never get back again.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Strangely boring<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
*****Spoiler Alert *****So I went to see Beauty and the Beast as the film I wanted to see had
juuuuuuust started and I don&#x27;t like to miss even 30 seconds of a film.I&#x27;ve only ever seen the original cartoon once when it came out, however
many years ago, so don&#x27;t remember it that well.This film looks beautiful, the sets and locations are wonderful, but it
does;t look nearly as good as Cinderella funnily enough. For me it all
look far too fake and yes I know it&#x27;s a musical and that&#x27;s not real,
but I was constantly aware that I was watching a film, rather than
getting into the film.I found the whole film strangely boring, I was looking at my watch,
wondering why everything took so long to happen and why we had to be
told three or four times that Gaston was the baddie, especially where
there were no other suitable candidates around.Emma whats-her-face who plays Belle is terribly terribly dull, and
really doesn&#x27;t do much of the acting, which is a shame as she has been
good as a supporting actress before, and maybe this is too much? The Beast looks silly, and does&#x27;t quite work as a beast. too much CGI
or not enough one of the two.Kevin Kline is excellent, as is Mr candle-stick and Fat-clock. But Emma
Thompson set my teeth on edge as the &#x27;east-end&#x27; common-as-much Mrs
Potts. Too much of the acting thing here.The songs are all exactly the same as before and I would have though
someone with a bit of vision might have jazzed them up a bit. The kids in the cinema seemed to love it but I just felt it was
desperately un-imaginative. Give me Kong: Skull Island any day.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>My Disney experience in ruins. Hogwarts is nearby...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
A huge disappointment.The only thing great about this film is probably the animation of the
supporting characters (ie. The candle / clocks, etc). Well done in that
area.However, Producers made a huge mistake in casting Emma Watson as Belle.
With her usual &#x27;too knowing&#x27; look and accent, watching the film is like
watching the Harry Potter star making a parody appearance. The strong
English Accent is cringey throughout the film and Emma clearly is not a
believable Belle. One of the original Belle&#x27;s main features are her big
luscious eyes batting gracefully and innocently. Whether the Producers
are looking for a modern Belle or not, the casting failed miserably. With all the hype, I was truly hoping for a &#x22;a movie that you must
watch at least once in your lifetime&#x22; quality and vibe. There was
clearly none here and it was as if the producers are given a big budget
due to their status, but rushed on the set up without applying a
masterpiece-making creative direction, completing the film on a whim,
throwing in a couple of big names and making do with clear super
imposed backgrounds. The opening scenes with Belle was as if it was all
filmed in a small studio section with no air. Those who find her accent
refreshing as Belle are just pulling the strings back to something
favourable in their imagination and to settle with acceptance.With the plot and characters already well known and predictable, they
should have captured other aspects of making it a big modern classic -
such as going &#x27;outstanding&#x27; on vocals and emotional pulls. There was no
effort here and the main characters are heavily set on auto tune and
heavily lacking of real emotions.The film is worth watching if you&#x27;re curious, and it will be sufficient
to please the kids who tend to enjoy a subtle entertaining objective
expressions in a simple plot, but with the potential it had from the
start, the film makers failed to go the mile. A true waste.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty and The Beast...what is lost cannot be found.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
To kick things off, let me say I&#x27;ve been a Disney fan since the
beginning. Beauty and the Beast, the original animated version, was
leaps and bounds more enjoyable. This version removes the soul of the
story. Disney didn&#x27;t seem to want to be bothered by what would actually
be enjoyable to watch, or more, what would be important to keep you
engaged. Emma Watson simply was a poor representation of Belle. She
tried, I&#x27;ll give her that, but it would&#x27;ve looked more natural seeing
the strings the director tied Watson&#x27;s appendages to make her move
about the scenes. Beyond Watson&#x27;s contribution to the film, the Beast was just plain bad
design. Disney has been pushing out films for decades, but can&#x27;t get
the CGI remotely on par with today&#x27;s standards? Luke Williams provided
a great representation of Gaston however, so the film has that going
for it. Pointing out the topic which received the most controversy, the
forcefully presented sexual affiliation of character Lefou was just bad
taste on Disney&#x27;s part. While the banter and side context between
Gaston/Lefou was somewhat entertaining, the portrayal of homosexual
desire designed by Disney in this Children&#x27;s film was bad judgment and
part of a seemingly larger agenda.In short, if you are expecting to see a wholesome family film, this
isn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;ve got no problem with homosexual references in adult
films, but this is for kids. Disney was previously unbiased and was
successful. If this new direction continues, I can say Disney will more
than likely lose a good deal of business from a much larger, more
value-driven number of communities.

So this is Disney&#x27;s latest attempt at making one of their animated
classics a live action classic, and while it doesn&#x27;t reach the
incredibly high bar the original set I still found it pretty enjoyable.
What really impressed me about this film were the visuals and the
acting. This movie is just gorgeous to look at, the sets are just so
grand in size that you can&#x27;t help but become mesmerized by it, and the
effects for the Beast and his servants were very well integrated into
the live action. It also didn&#x27;t hurt that the movie had an amazing
cast; Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad just nail each
of their characters and I never thought of the characters as being
played by actors, I thought of them as the same characters from the
original and that&#x27;s impressive acting right there. Do that&#x27;s what I
liked about Beauty and the Beast but there are two flaws with this
flick. Alright so remember all the positive things I just said about
the film because I&#x27;m about to say something that will make most people
really mad, Emma Watson&#x27;s singing was dull. Watson did a nice job in
the acting category but when it came time to sing it didn&#x27;t sound like
she was really getting into it, it sounded like someone with little
musical background reading the lyrics and trying way too hard to prove
she can sing, not bad singing just dull singing. With that being said
the rest of the cast did do a nice job with the musical parts, I hate
to single out Watson as the one singer who didn&#x27;t nail the singing but
that is the case, and because she does the majority of the singing in
the film it does bring the movie down a notch. So overall I really did
like this film, it had good acting and nice visuals, and even though it
might have lacked originality and not all the songs were masterpieces
it is still a fun adaptation that respects its source material, and I
would definitively recommend people see it if they haven&#x27;t already.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Gaston and LeFou<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie should have been called Gaston and LeFou because they share
more chemistry than the titular characters. I&#x27;m convinced that the
casting of Emma Watson had more to do with cashing in on name
recognition than acting ability. After all, the generation that grew up
with Beauty and the Beast also grew up with Harry Potter.
Unfortunately, Watson seems to have graduated from the Kristen Stewart
school of acting that entails keeping the same blank expression with
her mouth slightly agape. I could forgive her auto tuned singing if she
had brought some interesting characterization to Belle but she didn&#x27;t.
It doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of the dialog in this film is directly
copied from the script of the 1991 animated version because it leads to
unfavorable comparisons. Also, the Beast&#x27;s CGI looks terrible. They
should have stuck with practical effects. Speaking of the Beast, he
doesn&#x27;t show the same range of emotions that the animated one does and
is completely forgettable. The only musical number in which anyone
looks like they are having any fun is &#x22;Gaston.&#x22; Speaking of musical
numbers, the only thing more disappointing than Emma Watson&#x27;s singing
is Emma Thompson&#x27;s singing. The entire ballroom scene falls flat
because of her. Why not cast Audra McDonald as Mrs. Potts?TLDR: Don&#x27;t waste your time, just watch the animated film
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>what if she&#x27;s the one..<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty And The BeastBeautiful, customary and a bit too long. The part which has to be look
upon is screenplay, dialogues and d.o.p. but this is where the movie
loses its track. The storyline is strong for obvious reasons but the
film lacks to keep you invest in it. The movie lacks character
development hence the viewer fails to put it&#x27;s heart in it. The music
is good but some songs were irrelevant and the movie fails to surprise
the viewers and hold on to the seat, even 129 minutes seems&#x200B; like ages. A typical musical movie with nothing new in it, think twice before
spending your bucks.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not worth it<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Emma Watson is wooden and has limited facial expressions. You would
think she&#x27;d be used to emoting with CGI, having made all those Harry
Potter movies. The prince is no looker either; hard to believe these
were the most attractive people they could come up with.I also had trouble with some of the goofs. When Gaston and the father
set off to find Belle they imply that it&#x27;s taking forever to get
through the wintry forest to his castle, yet when Belle leaves the
castle to go look for her father it takes her about 2 minutes to get to
the town.I know little girls won&#x27;t care about that but it bugged me.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Thumbs down<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Emma great actress, very poor casting! I just couldn&#x27;t buy the
Hogwart&#x27;s wizard as Belle....I wanted her to look and sound like a
totally different character. She made me hate mud bloods Any muggle
with better vocals and a SMILE would have been better. But.......Great
to here the songs again!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappointing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I think even if you&#x27;ve never seen beauty and the beast certain parts of
this movie still wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable. As everyone is saying and I
can also affirm, this COULD have been a great movie. I love Emma Watson
but she was a complete miscast. At no point did her singing ever sound
real or natural it was auto tuned beyond belief. I felt like I was
listening to a computer. I think even if they dubbed her singing over
it would&#x27;ve been a stronger choice. Occasionally even some of her lines
are delivered very dryly which I found sad because I was really rooting
for her to prove everyone wrong. Everyone else was great. The beast I
think was a miscast too though, after he transforms at the end you&#x27;ll
find something just looks and feels awkward and not very Prince like
about him. Just go watch the original. The issue with Hollywood is
they&#x27;re more concerned with $ than taking the time to cast the right
people even if they have to be unknowns who can at least hold a tune.
If you want to see amazing live action stick with Favreau&#x27;s films and
go watch Jungle Book or wait for his live action lion king. His films
are never a let down.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Monotony and the Bleak<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This film could have been brilliant. I know that Disney&#x27;s live-action
remakes can be great. I loved Disney&#x27;s 2014 Maleficent and the 2015
Cinderella remake. However I hated Disney&#x27;s 2016 remake of The Jungle
Book (an absolute classic ruined!). Anyway, Beauty and the Beast... I
really thought I was going to love this film. This film feels so flat
in comparison to Maleficent and Cinderella. It relies heavily on CGI
(note to Bill Condon - you can chuck in as many special effects as you
like - but if your script is awful and the characters are dull then
there&#x27;s no point at all). It starts with a prince being cursed because
he&#x27;s too into his looks and not charitable enough (how Gaston gets away
with not being cursed by Agathe later on in the film as well I do not
understand - seeing as he also judges her by her appearance just like
the prince did). Next is Belle (Emma Watson under a heap of auto tuning
equipment basically) singing &#x22;Little Town&#x22;. It felt so unnatural and
forced and was actually quite awkward to watch. That&#x27;s when I started
to think &#x22;hmm I don&#x27;t think this is going to live up to expectation&#x22;.
The script is bad throughout. When Gaston is trying to win over Belle
in the beginning it&#x27;s actually such uncomfortable viewing. The lines of
dialogue don&#x27;t flow naturally between the actors at all. Does Emma
Watson think that Belle is a feminist icon (as she has stated so much
since being cast in this film) simply because she turns down Gaston??
Is that it?! Because there really doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything feminist
about Belle whatsoever as far as I can understand. Oh, she can read. Um
so I guess therefore she&#x27;s a feminist. Right... Over to the beast&#x27;s
castle then (are we expected to believe that the townspeople had never
noticed this huge run-down castle covered in snow and ice, which
apparently only takes a quick horse ride to get to??) and the weird
half CGI / half human beast has imprisoned Belle&#x27;s dad. Belle goes to
rescue her dad (played by Kevin Kline who delivers a forgettable
performance - but who can blame him with such a dull script to work
with). Belle changes places with her dad and is now the prisoner
instead of him. I really do not understand why so few of the characters
speak in a French accent. The film is set in France and yet nearly all
the characters have British accents. Why would you make the effort to
have SOME characters speak in a French accent, but not ALL the
characters?! That doesn&#x27;t make sense. The song sequences feel rushed
(Be Our Guest - what was that??!! A CGI mess!!). I didn&#x27;t like Belle&#x27;s
yellow dress. It reminded me of a dress that Drisella or Anastasia
would wear in Cinderella. The ruffles on each side looked awful and the
&#x22;Tale as old as time&#x22; ballroom sequence was nowhere near special or
magical enough. It was actually a bit dull. There was no heart and no
chemistry between Belle and Beast. Belle and Beast have a rushed couple
of scenes where they &#x22;fall in love&#x22; apparently - again without any
chemistry between them jumping off the screen. There&#x27;s a really weird
scene where Belle and Beast teleport to Paris circa the year that
Belle&#x27;s mother died. But it really doesn&#x27;t have much significance or
poignance (maybe by that point I just didn&#x27;t care about the story or
the characters anymore - as it was getting so boring!). Actually
thinking about it, this should have been an amazing moment full of
emotion and significance but once it again it felt pointless, rushed,
and flat. The townspeople eventually find out about the Beast and
Gaston leads all the awful townspeople (who annoyingly never get any
kind of comeuppance for being so hateful and vulgar) to the castle to
kill the beast. I was hoping the librarian might jump in and surprise
us all by being a hero as he didn&#x27;t really join in on the cheering when
everyone was gearing up to follow Gaston. But nope, no twists or
interest like that were permitted. Gaston and Beast fight it out until
Gaston falls to his death. Belle and Beast don&#x27;t profess their love for
each other in time before the last rose petal falls so the animated
household items turn back into inanimate objects and Beast will stay a
Beast forever. Right?? That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re led to believe the whole film.
Wrong. It&#x27;s all OK because it turns out Agathe can just magic the rose
back together whenever she feels like it - so actually the Beast always
had as long as he needed to fall in love and the rose timer - as it
turns out- was irrelevant. I hated the ending where everyone is just
dancing exactly like in the very opening scene of the film. Basically
there should be a voice-over in the end after all that saying &#x22;nothing
changed and no one learned anything and the castle went back to doing
nothing but throwing parties again and everyone was still very much
focused on only looks.&#x22; ... Belle fell in love with a Beast but thank
goodness he&#x27;s not really a Beast he&#x27;s actually a handsome prince!
Phew!! What kind of message is that???? What was the point of this
film?? What were the messages?? I didn&#x27;t get it. The characters, the
acting, the singing, the script, the storyline all fell completely
flat. No heart and no soul. Disney - please don&#x27;t keep creating remakes
for the sake of it! If it&#x27;s not going to be better than the original
then please don&#x27;t bother. I&#x27;m worried because I&#x27;ve heard that remakes
of The Lion King and Aladdin are on their way to being produced. Oh
great more auto tuning and CGI overload...
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney doesn&#x27;t care for their audience anymore<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I don&#x27;t know if anyone had high expectations for this movie, but
they&#x27;ll be certainly disappointed. There is nothing original in this
film, and technically is trash: the photography is mediocre, the
editing was terrible, the acting was awful; and the songs, most of them
are so lame even kids would feel too embarrassed to sing them.Is a shame that Disney had everything to make a decent film (the budget
was tremendous, the sets were fine, the cast could have been better)
and the special effects were good in some parts) but miss their chance
and decided to destroy the childhood memories of those who once loved
Beauty and the Beast.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Average OK.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was hoping for something more for this movie. However the acting was:
OK, the script was: OK, the visual effects and everything surrounding
it is ...again OK.It is a good re-edited version of Disnesys beauty and the beast cartoon
movie but it wasn&#x27;t as good as it could be. Nevertheless it is a good
film you can watch with the children or with your girlfriend. For me it was just an average movie, nothing spectacular or different,
just an old Disney movie in a new dress so to speak.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A good, though far from great, adaptation of this tale as old as time.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Adapting Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve&#x27;s original French story
about a beauty and her beast is no easy task. In the wrong hands, this
romance between a girl and her captor could easily come across as
creepy &#x96; Stockholm Syndrome parading as a fairy tale. Disney managed to
pull it off in 1991: its sublime animated version, with its tender
heart and gorgeous music, has rightly become a classic. 25 years later,
has the studio managed to capture lightning in a bottle again, this
time in live-action format?Well&#x85; not quite. To be fair, this brand-new incarnation of Beauty And
The Beast, directed by Bill Condon, has a great deal going for it. It
makes a good case for updating the tale with more modern sensibilities.
The film is beautifully performed and designed, and there&#x27;s plenty of
fun (and nostalgia) awaiting fans of its animated predecessor. But it
never feels quite as effortless or natural in telling its story. While
there is magic here, it&#x27;s tough to shake the feeling that it&#x27;s
engineered, not organic &#x96; that it grazes rather than grabs the heart.The film centres on Belle (Emma Watson), a bookish, resourceful young
lady who&#x27;s never really fit into her little French village. She hankers
for adventure &#x96; but gets more than she bargained for when her father
(Kevin Kline) stumbles into a forgotten castle and becomes a prisoner
there. After trading places with her dad, Belle gets to know the
inhabitants of the castle: a surly, fearsome Beast (Dan Stevens) and a
host of living household appliances and furniture, all of them living
in fear that they will never be free of the curse that has robbed them
of their humanity.On its own merits, Beauty And The Beast is a decent effort. Condon&#x27;s
film is the Hollywood blockbuster at its most efficient, from its
photo-real fantasy castles to splashy musical numbers teeming with life
and colour. The screenplay, by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos,
is a canny adaptation of familiar material, particularly when it comes
to adding layers to its characters. Belle has more agency in ways big
and small &#x96; she&#x27;s the one in control even when she (voluntarily)
becomes the Beast&#x27;s prisoner and, in a small but important scene, she
shares the gift of independent thinking by teaching a village girl how
to read. Similarly, the many relationships in the film are given welcome depth.
Belle and the Beast find common ground in books and feeling
out-of-place, even in the places they call home. We&#x27;re furnished with
hints as to why the household servants &#x96; including suave candlestick
Lumiere (Ewan McGregor), jittery clock Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) and
motherly kettle Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) &#x96; are more invested in
breaking the curse that befell them. LeFou&#x27;s (Josh Gad) devotion to the
pompous Gaston (Luke Evans) goes, quite logically, from subtext to
text, though in a way that hardly warrants the firestorm of controversy
that has erupted in conservative circles over Disney&#x27;s &#x27;gay agenda&#x27;.That said, other aspects of this remake yield more mixed results. The
Beast&#x27;s very real, very human eyes provide emotional connection and
depth in a way that animation can&#x27;t fully approximate. But burying
Stevens beneath layers of CGI and prosthetics also means that the Beast
can occasionally come across as a stiff, oversized teddy bear, lacking
the fluidity of expression of his animated counterpart. The same goes
for the household servants: ironically, efforts to make them more
&#x27;realistic&#x27; end up bleeding them of life and personality. It&#x27;s the same story with the film&#x27;s music. Some of Alan Menken and
Howard Ashman&#x27;s iconic original numbers are thoughtfully re- imagined:
&#x27;Be Our Guest&#x27; is a joyous explosion of camp colour, featuring welcome
nods to movies like Cabaret and Singin&#x27; In The Rain; and &#x27;Gaston&#x27;
morphs into a lively bar-storming number that practically demands
applause at the end. But the new songs, penned by Menken and Tim Rice, are more nice than
necessary. &#x27;How Does A Moment Last Forever&#x27; is lovely but lacks impact.
&#x27;Evermore&#x27; &#x96; a new anthem for the Beast &#x96; will no doubt become a
cabaret standard but is badly served in the context of the film: it
feels overwrought and a bit silly, lessening rather than heightening
the dramatic tension at that particular moment. Performances across the board are good, as you would expect from a cast
of this calibre &#x96; though it&#x27;s hard not to wish for accomplished
performers like Thompson, McKellen and Broadway legend Audra McDonald
(playing the part of an operatic, narcoleptic wardrobe) to be better
served by both script and special effects. Watson, who has proved a
better advocate than actor in recent years, is a perfectly credible
(though hardly riveting) Belle. Stevens does a decent job with a
challenging part, while Evans convincingly conjures up both swagger and
menace.It&#x27;s evident in every frame that everyone involved in Beauty And The
Beast worked mightily hard to prove that transforming one of Disney&#x27;s
most iconic movies into a live-action extravaganza is worth the effort.
They don&#x27;t always pull it off: the film gets about as many things wrong
as it does right, and it most certainly doesn&#x27;t surpass the animated
classic in quality. But it tells a familiar tale well enough &#x96; enough,
one suspects, to win over fans old and new.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Quite Average<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When you take on a classic like Beauty and the Beast for a live action
movie which was also nominated for the Best Picture by the Academy you
HAVE to make sure that the spirit of the original remains intact even
if you can&#x27;t make it as good. I know that one has to tweak a few little
things to make it appropriate not just for the new generation but also
as a live action movie though without making it look cheesy or over the
top... which quite sadly was not the case with this one... it was
directed by an Oscar winning director (who also directed a twilight
movie which sucks) and a studio that has recently produced better than
the original adaptation of the jungle book which I really love... so
one wonders what must have gone wrong... that I think we will find out
later but for now if I have to say something positive about this movie
it would be its visual effects which were quite gorgeous if not
entirely believable, the design of the CGI characters which were a
reminiscence of the original ones, Belle played by Emma Watson though
not as great as I wanted her to be, seems to have done her job. And
even if the songs didn&#x27;t flow as greatly with the story as it did
before, you could still enjoy them. The choreography, set design and
the costumes also stole the show along with the Humour because of its
talented cast even if it seemed a little cheesy at places, it managed
to make me laugh (especially Gaston) hence making it a better movie
than it really was... I will give it a 7/10...P.S.- You may enjoy it because of the nostalgia factor.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Essentially, a perfect remake<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When this film was first announced, skepticism was of course running
rampant. The original animated film from 1991 is widely considered a
masterpiece and one of Disney&#x27;s best films. Doing the story justice
with real actors of flesh and blood was going to be a challenge. That
was no secret. So how does the finished film compare to the original?
Thankfully, I found Bill Condon&#x27;s take on the &#x22;tale as old as time&#x22; to
be surprisingly refreshing. It&#x27;s a great new spin on a story we&#x27;re all
familiar with. But by taking elements from the original that worked
well the first time and changing what did not, this adaptation of
Beauty and the Beast is easily what I consider to be the most
successful Disney remake we&#x27;ve seen yet.For the most part, the film takes the setting of it&#x27;s story very
seriously. Costumes and sets are all tailored and designed to
perfection. And similar to Cinderella (2015), the film feels more like
a period piece then a live action spin on a cartoon. The production
design team were clearly trying very hard to make you believe that this
is 1770&#x27;s France and I think they definitely succeeded. There is some
great craftsmanship at work here. This might seem like only a minor
aspect of the overall spectacle, but Disney has run into some trouble
before in terms of accurately representing history. Needless to say,
that was scarcely a problem in this film. One of the most prevalent things about this film I can say for it is
that it has one of the most superb casts I&#x27;ve seen in a long while. Say
what you will about Emma Watson&#x27;s singing abilities, but she certainly
looks the part of Belle, if nothing else. She is beautiful, intelligent
and strong. Everything that we loved about Belle in the original
translates nicely to this version. But the actor who deserves the most
of my praise is Luke Evans as Gaston. Right from the moment he was
announced, I knew he would be nothing but phenomenal in the role. And I
was happily correct. Evans brings a fierce intensity to the character
that was not present in the original. Gaston, it seems was a part that
he was born to play.Other noticeable performances include Josh Gad as Gaston&#x27;s meek side
kick, Lefou; a side villain who is greatly improved upon in this
version; and Kevin Kline as Belle&#x27;s father, Maurice. He brings a quiet
and sincere quality to the character, contrasting greatly with his
over-the-top persona in the original. Dan Stevens is also quite
excellent as the cursed Prince. Having no prior knowledge of the
actor&#x27;s previous works, I was nervous to see how he would deal with
playing such a complex character. Thankfully my worries were put to
rest over the course of the film. He exudes a lot of humanity and charm
through layers of CGI and has a strong singing voice to boot.In my humble opinion, Beauty and the Beast is a nearly perfect remake.
It changes what didn&#x27;t work before and keeps what did. It adds new
songs which are as equally powerful as the old classics we know. The
care, love and attention to detail is hugely apparent in every scene.
It is a well crafted and high spirited effort to bring a beloved
animated feature to life. Now that the next string of Disney remakes have been revealed, we may
soon experience a new and prosperous period for the company, one with
more momentum and success than the Disney Renaissance. But for now, let
Beauty and the Beast serve as the example for how to make a proper and
successful remake that doesn&#x27;t lose any of the heart of it&#x27;s
predecessor. It&#x27;s a charming, emotional and passionate story that will
always be adored for all time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Classic Disney Adaption<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Movie stayed so loyal to it&#x27;s predecessor, classic Disney adaption,
usually not my cup of tea, but i love the musical screenplay in this
live-action version of the beauty and the beast along with it&#x27;s perfect
sets, locations, costumes and visuals. Despite the fact that plot holds
no surprises, Director Bill Condon made sure that movie still keep it&#x27;s
charm and deliver an enjoyable experience. As for Emma Watson, she was
ideal for this role, Belle&#x27;s character is of a strong and inspiring
young girl who doesn&#x27;t deal things by traditional society rules and
always seeks for better change, so it is something Watson can relate
with, that&#x27;s why she played Belle so passionately.If you like the fast pace, 120 minutes of mayhem type of movies, so
this movie is definitely not for you, but if you like
to...sometimes...sit back, relax and focus on the details and envy the
art, then it is a very delightful experience.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>On point with the Disney animation + some.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I loved it. It held true to the Disney animation that three of my girls
have loved (10, 14, 18). My oldest daughter is 18 years old and my
youngest is 10. I have watched the Disney animation for 18 + years(to
include the the story lines I was exposed to as a child). The 2017
version was exceptionally brilliant. It held true to the old Disney
version (plus some) and evoked many memories of watching the animation
with all three of my daughters as little girls. This particular version
added some extra lessons/themes needed to be addressed and taught
relevant to this time and age/generation (though not directly stated
great minds will draw the conclusions to the underlying theme). I loved
it!!!!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>very far from the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The original Beauty and the beast was part of my childhood and I still
love it to this day. That being said, I really wanted to like the
remake as well. Sadly, it did not come up to my expectations, for
everything I saw was merely a visually beautiful shell that did not
cover even 50 % of the quality of the 90s classic. The animated film is
cinematically and plot-wise better than the live action remake. Some of
the scenes were better done and more believable in the animation rather
than the live action version(the wolves scene comes to mind as well as
the moment Belle finds the rose)The characters are really not well
written, especially Watson&#x27;s Belle who is just really Watson&#x27;s alter
ego and not the Belle I used to watch dozens of times and come to love.
Ema&#x27;s performance comes really weak, especially that the animated
character was more emotional and convincing to me. Dan Stevens&#x27; Beast&#x27;s
sense of humour was a pleasant surprise, though at moments his behavior
was really out of character (prefering Belle to stay in the dungeon,
Ms. Potts declaring that he loves Belle, instead of him doing so) and
his song was really unnecessary, since his silent suffering over losing
Belle in the original was better executed. Gaston was just unconvincing
with his at times chaotic behavior, despite Luke Evans being a good
actor. Honorable mention goes to Ewan McGreggor, Ian McKellen and Josh
Gad, who did well as Lumiere, Cogsworth and LeFou, respectively. The
movie delivers in terms of songs and choreography, since it&#x27;s Disney&#x27;s
specialty, as well in visual effects, but I fear they lost track in
telling a good story, given the fact that most of the time it is about
characters&#x27; social issues, rather than a good old love story(Belle
trying to get out of oh, so boring town full of people who are really
beneath her and ultimately getting herself into the clutches of the
ugly cold-hearted beast, who was taxing the villagers beforehand, so
that he can adorn himself with things most beautiful; Belle not keeping
her end of the agreement and trying to escape all the time; Beast being
cruel because he lost his mother and was raised by an evenly cruel
father... the most sensitive theme for some in the movie, which got the
movie itself a ban in certain countries, Le Fou&#x27;s sexuality was well
presented, though, with a soft touch in humour in his dialogues with
Gaston, and the character switching sides at the end). All in all, if
you want to see a classic, that will last for years to come and will
continue to inspire, go to the classic!

This is bad, I mean real bad movie. How can Disney make Beauty and the
Beast this awful? I mean, watch the movie and you&#x27;ll know that it&#x27;s
clearly don&#x27;t have atmosphere (genre), the cast just dance around and
singing I think this&#x27;ll end up as one of toddler bluray&#x27;s movies
collection, but shame this is not funny at all. This is not a drama, I
can&#x27;t feel the comedy, and the beast don&#x27;t give me a thriller too (I
thought this movie is gonna darker than the 2014 french version, but
it&#x27;s too light!). So what exactly is this movie genre? It feels empty,
non atmosphere cause Disney make the people who watch became so lost
and find it boring. Except for the toddlers.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Does Have Autotuning, Too Much CGI, and I Miss 1991 Belle<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I like the interracial coupling, the ambiguously gay vibe, very few
songs (not the ones Belle and others singing), and how the witch was
not taking the Prince&#x27;s arrogant crap that harmed his village by not
letting people that were inferior than him to get resources to make
them more sophisticated to make them have slave mentalities. I do not
like how Emma Watson sounded like she was not classically trained with
singing, which the 1991 version had an authentic Broadway sound. Disney
is not wanting people who can actually belt out a note by actually
working without autotuning involved, it seems. I do not like how the
CGI is conducted into this messy remake. Though, I liked the CGI in the
&#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; song, the flashback of The Prince&#x27;s childhood, and The
Prince&#x27;s mirror scenes. Otherwise, it made The Beast&#x27;s face look
expressionless from time to time. Also, I am sorry Emma. The 1991
version of Belle captured my attention before your portrayal of Belle
did. Plus, there is always something about animations that I delve
into.

A beautifully made movie. A real throwback to my childhood. Great
casting. Emma Watson is a perfect choice for Belle. And Kevin Kline -
spot on. Really well-done.Hearing the rumors and reading the negative reviews made me postpone
the watching of the movie. But, I&#x27;m glad I watched it. I really don&#x27;t
understand what did the negative reviewers expect from the movie. It
has everything it needs and a bit more. Some of the characters are really funny and sweet, which was a sight
for sore eyes. Characters were really thoroughly, carefully and as they
should be - managed.My only complaint is Dan Stevens playing the Beast. I felt a whole lot
more sparks between him and Belle, while he was an actual beast. When
he transformed into a prince, I really wasn&#x27;t feeling it. I had a
feeling he was a completely different person. He was a bit annoying
too, I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe because I thought he didn&#x27;t deserve her.
There are a dozen great actors that would be exceptionally good choice
for the Beast.Really pleasant surprise and I recommend it to everyone, you won&#x27;t be
disappointed.

Let&#x27;s get this straight straight: this movie is bad.I have been looking for comfort in the negative reviews of other people
in this site (why, God, did I not read them before watching this?) and
I feel almost everything has been pointed out: bad acting, bad CGI,
plain characters, absurd narrative resources... I feel, however, that many critics have missed an extra negative point
which for me was vital: the ridiculous depiction of France, which can
not only be ascribed to ignorance but to exaggerated characterization
of the American idea of french people not at some point in history,
just in &#x22;some past time&#x22;: a castle in the middle of nowhere filled with
baroque, wig-wearing, overly made-up aristocrats, combined with
middle-age plague masks and, especially annoyingly, African- American
characters completely integrated in this epoque-less society. I
understand Disney intent and praise them for it, but an
African-American priest is just so historically inaccurate that I could
never really get into the story and forget I was watching a movie from
outside. For someone a little familiar with European history, this
characterization was forced, artificial, excessive, totally unnecessary
for the plot, and overall a constant reminder of how terrible this
movie was.A piece of advice: better watching the animated masterpiece of 1991
(again) than losing your time with this movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It was OK-Good!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I am not a fan of musicals but I went to watch this one out of
nostalgia. I like the fact that they kept the original songs. Unlike a
LOT of people in here, I did not mind the autotune because I didn&#x27;t
want to hear the voices of the actors if they were bad. Now people will
complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end
of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really
glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a
remake I don&#x27;t expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the
original. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one is
definitely coming, you&#x27;ll get your different story. The visuals were OK
but could have been better especially Belle&#x27;s village.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Ill conceived, half baked and poorly executed.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This is just horrible, cringe-worthy comes to mind.The &#x22;new&#x22; musical
scores stand out in nauseating contrast to the much better original
songs. I don&#x27;t know who writes these musical scores but this is not the
first &#x22;musical&#x22; to strike my upchuck cord. It must be some new style,
sing your script as badly as you can manage. Les Miserables (the new
one) was the first thing that popped into my head when I heard the
first terrible addition to the score. Even good actors can&#x27;t help this
kind of writing. If the singing wasn&#x27;t bad enough the CGI will certainly send you into
the realms of disbelief. One would think that Disney would be able to
hire competent 3D character artists and animators. The &#x22;beast&#x22; looks
completely unbelievable, hell, it&#x27;s anatomy doesn&#x27;t even flow
correctly. This reliance on CG for everything is killing the industry.
Why do you need CGI wolves? All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t give this piece of money grabbing puke more than
a 5/10. I rate it 1 because it&#x27;s rating is sickeningly inflated. Even
my 9 year old enjoyed poking fun at it more than watching it. This
should not have been made. The cartoon was brilliant, this is
forgettable garbage.

Out of all the Disney remakes, I think this one might the worst.I&#x27;ll give credit where it&#x27;s due, the movie is really gorgeous. And the
actors playing the servants are all fantastic. In fact, I think they&#x27;re
the best part of the movie to be honest. Luke Evans is hilarious as
Gaston and Josh Gad was a fantastic Le Fou. The music was decent but
they added two new songs. Days in the Sun is fine until Watson starts
singing and Evermore was pretty good.But in all complete honesty, this movie is just not that great.First of all, why did they cast Emma Watson? She is not a singer and
you can tell in this movie. Why cast a singer if she can&#x27;t sing? Not
only that but she looks bored throughout the whole movie. Also, the
romance between her and Beast never feels realized. It seems like the
Beast cares more about Belle. There is also this random subplot about Belle&#x27;s mother that goes
nowhere. It feels really awkward and there was zero reason for it to be
in the film. But my biggest pet peeve is that they cast one of the greatest vocalist
of all time, Audra McDonald, as the wardrobe.Are you kidding me!?She has the best voice in the whole entire movie and they stick her as
the wardrobe!? Why?!I say skip this movie unless you have little girls who are dying to see
it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Well done<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Emma Watson does better than average work as Belle, and a host of other
characters make this classic come to life. If that truly is Watson&#x27;s
voice, she can sing fairly well; although I wouldn&#x27;t expect her to
release a solo album in this lifetime. Could they have done better in
casting someone else for Belle? Absolutely. But I guess name
recognition had something to do with this. Watson seems rigid at times,
and lacks real emotion where it is needed in this film. Still, the
amount of CGI, costumes, and other parts of this movie make it well
worth watching. I don&#x27;t get all the controversy over a gay character,
because frankly, I didn&#x27;t see it, and I was looking for it. But I guess
some people need to make controversy when there is none. And not that
it honestly matters in the grand scheme of things, but they would have
been fine with not remaking the theme song that was originally sung by
Peabo Bryson and Celine Dion. That&#x27;s a classic version that is better
off left alone. John Legend and Ariana Grande don&#x27;t come close to
pulling that song off the way Celine and Peabo did. But like most
musical talent today - they lack their own creativity and talent,
compared to what used to be considered star power.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Different Experience than the Cartoon, But Enchanting in its own way<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This live action remake of the beloved Disney cartoon takes liberties
with the cartoon source. Is that a good thing? I thought so. Kids may
prefer the animated classic, but if you want to see an enchanted castle
in more vivid detail, or see the Beast as a more human character who is
well read and a little sarcastic at times, then I think you may
appreciate this version. I always felt like the cartoon version of the
Beast was a little annoying. He had a bad temper and seemed like a
typical angry male who needed to &#x22;learn&#x22; to be more loving. The Beast
in this movie is less of a man-child and more of a worldly (but angry)
individual. The film has a couple of weaknesses, depending on your
tastes. First, the computer animated objects feel more like extensions
of the castle than characters themselves. But to my thinking that
wasn&#x27;t a bad thing. In animated films those characters are constantly
making jokes, trying to keep the kids entertained. In this film they
are background characters (until the awkward ending). Second, the
singing does sound a bit auto-tuned, but is that such a big deal? This
is a fantasy movie, not Les Miserable. Still, it would have been
acceptable (to me) if they had hired ringers to sing the songs for some
actors. Lastly, much has been said about the surprising little moments
that open up the question of gay characters in a Disney film. You can
tell some people really don&#x27;t want to see even minor gay characters in
film. Frankly, I don&#x27;t see why anyone should care so much. I would say
if one or two moments (that are over in seconds and less overt than
people make them out to be) trouble some viewers...well, maybe they
need to be troubled. Overall, it&#x27;s a good movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A classic in its own right<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As an unabashed fan of the 1991 film, I came to this version ready for
a fight -- more than one! Who dares tamper with a classic? But bit by
bit, and moment by moment, I was enchanted all over again: the human
performances &#x22;fleshed out&#x22; the old animated ones; the coggier Cogsworth
and more limited Lumiere charmed me afresh with their differences from
memory. The new songs, though surprising, fit remarkably well, and I
never felt that the score missed a beat. And when all was added up, the
sum was far more than any of the new and varied parts: this is a fresh
masterpiece, beginning as a riff but ending with something much much
more than a &#x22;cover&#x22; -- if Disney can do this as well with its other
planned live-action/CGI versions, then count me in. This is a
brilliantly-crafted film that honors and yet moves beyond its beloved
original.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty and the Beast (2017)<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The remake of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is Disney&#x27;s latest in live action
animation. Blending real actors with CGI, it&#x27;s a story most of us know
(and love) about Belle and the Beast. Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) plays Belle, a simple country girl
who is looking for her Prince Charming. She lives an ordinary life in
an ordinary town surrounded by ordinary people. Trouble is, they think
SHE&#x27;S strange. Gaston, the local hunk, has decided he must make Belle
his wife since she clearly isn&#x27;t interested in him. Fate, however, has
other plans for both of them.Although the film was very pretty to look at, it lacked depth and
simply did not have the heart the animated version had. I love Emma
Watson, but her singing voice was adequate at best. Kevin Kline (who
portrayed Belle&#x27;s father) looked like he would rather be anywhere but
where he was. It was Luke Evans (as Gaston) that stole the show. He stayed true to
the character of Gaston, and man could he belt out a tune! Another
problem I had is Disney trying to introduce a sexually confused
character, LeFou. I wish someone would try to explain to me why this
was done because, quite frankly, I am sick and tired of people trying
to rewrite fairy tales just to make them &#x22;politically correct.&#x22; Rated PG and even with its flaws, I would still recommend it.

I was going to put 4 stars but realized that everything is not as bad
as other people says. OK, some details are shocking if this story takes
place in France of middle age. But it&#x27;s fantasy so... Most of the songs
are good and it&#x27;s a good mix between the first version of Disney and
the Broadway show.And I like that... But if you don&#x27;t liked the story
in the animated movie, go away. It&#x27;s not a remake of the cocteau&#x27;s
movie and not even the last one with Vincent Cassel. It&#x27;s only a family
movie with many ingredients to make it work in movie theatres but not
many passion. You can laugh, you can cry but there&#x27;s a lack of
feelings. If you had all the mistakes I spoke in the beginning, that&#x27;s
a 5-6 stars.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappointed<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Now I wasn&#x27;t expecting a shot for shot remake, and this certainly is
not that. What I was expecting was something that entertained and gives
us a reason to revisit the near perfect 1991 animated version of this
film. What we got was heavily and horribly auto tuned Emma Watson,
among others and acting that hardly convinced you that anyone was
feeling anything genuine at all. The story quickly bored me and I found
myself doing other things on my cell phone while watching it, and I got
a feeling that the SJW lot had some meddling in how the character of
Belle was redone here. The CG was unconvincing, if not all together
overly done. I would skip this, as the animated version was way better,
and the emotions more raw and convincing.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not as good as the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The yellow &#x26; blue dresses are really ugly; Emma Watson brought NO
emotion to Belle, &#x26; the CGI was really bad. Beast did not look
intimidating like he did in the orin ginal, &#x26; Chip &#x26; Mrs. Potts have
human faces on them, which looks HORRIBLE. But I&#x27;m most angry that Emma
Watson was chosen to play Belle. Her singing &#x26; acting absolutely sucks,
&#x26; she had a blank/emotionless face the whole movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Aesthetics with zero substance...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was looking forward to the movie. Unfortunately, this turned out to
be just an expensive money-grab! I completely agree with those who say
that Ms Watson failed to deliver as Belle, though, honestly, I wasn&#x27;t
feeling any magic from Dan Stevens, either. Beginning of the movie looked promising, but it went downhill from
there. I found almost every scene with Belle and the Beast cringe
worthy, to say the least. Not to mention that last dance scene. The
whole movie actually felt choreographed and not acted, at all. The fact that everyone already knows the story going into the cinema to
see the movie, doesn&#x27;t excuse the sloppy mess this was made into. It
does not excuse zero effort in trying to convey any emotion and have us
drowning in overwhelming and unnecessary CGI. I felt as if watching a
fashion show with amateur actors trying to convince me its theme is
supposed to be &#x22;beauty and the beast&#x22;. Really, really disappointed!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Most vapid Disneyware do not watch<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Horrible, just awful aping of the original cartoon, a horrid CGI-fest,
done on a level of high-school animation homework. The singing is a
violation of the original tunes, and new songs are just a Miley Cyrus
level of terrible. Too bad some really good actors (and that does not
include both main characters) are paying some debt/ransom by
participating in this debauchery. Really, go watch the French one for
art, quality and acting, or original Disney cartoon for entertainment,
give this turd a wide berth, and save yourself the price of
ticket/rent.

I had the chance to see this movie with my daughter who is now married.
I saw the really Disney animation with her while raising her may be a
100 times and we went to cinema with great hopes but came out of cinema
with utmost disappointment. After all the best technology and available
CGs, the movie did not have any grip to the real spirit of the
animation made many years ago. I wish we would not have seen the movie
and instead would have gone home and would have seen animation on my
home theater.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>:/<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this but i will say i&#x27;m still more
disappointed than i&#x27;d hoped. The animated film is just so good, but
it&#x27;s like the people making the new one weren&#x27;t quite sure why.Just from a technical standpoint, the movie is really poorly made.
Really, really bad pacing. Similar length of many of the scenes we got
from the original but packed with three times the dialogue, which made
the whole thing rushed. A complete lack of dramatic breathing room in
scenes that should&#x27;ve had huge tension. (panning AWAY to a wide shot
for intense, iconic moments where there were closeups in the original)There were so many quick cuts and wide / medium shots it&#x27;s like the
director was afraid of spending too long on faces because the emotional
reactions were so short and simplified. The sets all had overhead,
bright lighting that took away a lot of the mystery and ambiance that
the animated version had. I doubt that kids would even really be able
to enjoy this more than the animated one too because the quick, rapid
lines don&#x27;t add anything new and are harder to pay attention to for
kids.The acting was bad all around, and even the really good actors in this
had their potential wasted, so i think a good half of the blame at
least falls on the script and directing.I will say that, with some exceptions, the costume designers and
production designers really went all-out on this. The first few shots
in the film are incredibly beautiful. But the camera doesn&#x27;t appreciate
them and maintains it&#x27;s wide and medium shots of everything, while
they&#x27;re lit with flat lighting. Frustratingly, Belle&#x27;s iconic
gold-yellow dress they made look like wet juicy fruit gum, even when
the extras are dressed to the nines, and the beast&#x27;s dramatic facial
design and color patterns in the original are gone and he&#x27;s just kind
of a gray blob.You might be able to enjoy the movie for its nostalgic quality or
because you like some of the actors but this really doesn&#x27;t show
anybody&#x27;s best qualities or give us a new take on the story, and it&#x27;s
best just to watch the original again.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Live Action Disney Adaptations -  Nostalgia Run Amok?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The question is exactly what do we expect from these Disney live action
remakes of classic animated films? Only you as a viewer or original fan
can fully answer that question.I will however at least from my point of view attempt to gain a
perspective given that we&#x27;ve been presented with three straight
remakes, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and in this instance Beauty and
the Beast.With each of these instances there&#x27;s arguments to be had in relation to
whether the original is an absolute classic, whether the film has
enough material to flesh out an extended live action feature or even
whether just on principal remaking Beauty and the Beast, a film that&#x27;s
universally adored by critics and audiences alike whether this&#x27;s even a
project that should be attempted.Lets focus on a couple of these aspects, I&#x27;ll admit that I had
intermittingly seen parts of the 1991 animated feature and was very
familiar with the songs but had never watched the film from beginning
to end until literally two weeks before seeing this years live action
adaptation so on one hand I don&#x27;t have the baggage of twenty years or
more of preconceptions for what the film should do in its live action
guise, however seeing both the film versions within the space of two
weeks does come with the advantage (or maybe baggage)&#xA0;of being able to
see things in a more mirrored perspective which with this film in
particular was a fascinating thing to behold.On the point I&#x27;ve just made I&#x27;m going to go down the road of them
recreating those scene moments with an accuracy which to many a fan I&#x27;m
sure was pure delight to simply see an exact mirrored scene only with a
live action cast, the opening Belle musical sequence is the
quintessential example of this with every aspect pretty much
identically replicated to a precision that I&#x27;ve not quite seen on this
large scale, yes we saw similar things like it in their Cinderella
adaptation a couple years ago but that film was so short with plenty of
potential to improve and to mould into something that isn&#x27;t exactly a
clone of it&#x27;s animated counterpart, however I would say that it didn&#x27;t
completely work for Cinderella and also in respect to The Jungle Book
Jon Favreau it would appear did want to go beyond what the Disney
animated feature did and made it certainly a more cinematic experience
type of film that although yes had nods to said animated film but did
have ambitions beyond those Disney constraints.To carry on that point I will simply go onto what I deem to be the
films greatest strength and unsurprisingly it is the musical sequences
of which the film lives and breaths off of, the question then becomes
what exactly are we enjoying about these sequences because haven&#x27;t we
already seen and heard them? Yes and no is my unsurprising conclusion
to this question, to focus on two songs in particular &#x27;Gaston&#x27; and &#x27;Be
Our Guest&#x27; these are impeccably entertaining songs in their own right
so why did these work even better in this format? I suppose it&#x27;s down
to the physical theatrical performance involved in recreating them,
specifically Gaston as so much of the song is for a comedic effect that
is only amplified with the performance song and dance piece that it is,
in respect to Be Our Guest the visual treat that the animated film
created again here is amplified to a splendiferous visual treat that
only a creative more physical form can lend to the sequence.What also must be said is that when talking about this more theatrical
performance and the positives it brings it&#x27;s also hugely reliant upon
the individual actors involved and with Gaston in particular Josh Gad,
Luke Evans and that whole ensemble are what gives that sequence the
strength it has, also the vocal performances of the Be Our Guest voice
cast is impeccable, equally when we&#x27;re talking about the opening Belle
sequence the same rule is applied, yes the song is adequately performed
by Emma Watson, but it&#x27;s hard when clearly we&#x27;ve heard this song
performed by a more than superior singer and given that the opening is
most certainly a scene for scene recreation of the animated feature the
startling contrast of such qualities are much more keenly and therefore
negatively noted by the viewer.I&#x27;m clearly going into many specifics that a normal reviewer would not
do but I&#x27;m trying to find out exactly what it is about these remakes
that we clearly flock to see as an audience, as this is part of a more
broader film debate given in other areas of the film world we&#x27;ve
experienced films like Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens,
films that overly rely on the audiences nostalgia for the past&#xA0;film
products in order to positively survive, yes that&#x27;s an extremely harsh
statement to make but given that Beauty and the Beast regularly just
recreates exact scenes from the past film the point I&#x27;m trying to
explore is exactly at what point does a remake or nostalgia kill or
make a film that is in front of you.In respect to this years Beauty and the Beast adaptation, my overall
reaction was one of differing feelings, there were the&#xA0;joys of those
particular musical&#xA0;moments being recreated, but equally I was unsure
what exactly the film generally was bringing to the table as a project,
the film does add some scenes to the fray for further context&#xA0;for main
characters and there was two extra songs, however I
particularly&#xA0;thought that although they did the film no harm&#xA0;I didn&#x27;t
think &#x27;oh isn&#x27;t it really good they&#x27;ve included that&#x27; So overall an
inconclusive reaction from me and I&#x27;m going to continue to have this
debate with myself but I do believe that a more capable group of film
reviewers/writers might be able to more articulate an argument.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A visual treat,<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the beast is a one time watchable movie for the visual treat
the movies offers. The locations,costumes,cinematography and production
designing is very good. Emma Watson charms as Belle. Luke Evans did a
very good job as the negative character. The songs will not get us
bored throughout the movie. This could win Academy nominations for
visual effects and production design. The screenplay is not good enough
for this entertaining plot. Still its a one time watchable for its
visual treats.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A pointless cash in<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Emma Watson is miscast as Belle; her performance is just unconvincing.
There&#x27;s nothing interesting done with the premise, the characters feel
flat and lifeless, the musical numbers are &#x22;meh&#x22;, and the graphics
don&#x27;t even reflect the big budget nature of the film; some things
actually manage to look bad. The hype for the film can clearly be
attributed just to marketing and it coasting on the original&#x27;s
reputation. I don&#x27;t even particularly mind corporate cash-in remakes if
they&#x27;re done well (see Disney&#x27;s Star Wars reboot), but this is not it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I&#x27;ll think of all that might have been&#x85;<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
To cut things short - that&#x27;s the classic Hollywood everybody wants to
watch in the cinema: grandiose, sumptuous, high-quality production.
Most chances you&#x27;d enjoy it enough to justify the ticket price. And
yet, it feels like the fast-chain snack food.In the marketing campaign and the overall reviews all you can hear is
about the Beauty, yet almost nothing about the Beast. If that&#x27;s not a
sign of a grave and essential problem with the movie, I don&#x27;t know what
is. His character is supposed to propel the story on the par with
Belle. Yet, her 2 ball gowns received more coverage than him &#x96; and
frankly speaking, both of them were quite disappointing from my point
of view. So, just for a change I&#x27;ll try to concentrate here on
Prince/Beast character.I never heard about Dan Stevens before, so I had no idea where he came
from and what to expect from him. Most of the movie he spends under
some of the unsuccessful CGI effects, including alternating his voice.
The results are uneven and not really convincing, to say the least.
Pretty hard to tell who&#x27;s to blame &#x96; the actor himself or the
technological wizards. We&#x27;ll probably never know.Let&#x27;s start with the fact that only on premier photos I noticed that
Stevens has perfectly suited eyes for the role &#x96; exactly as in 1991
version, piercing, blue color. Yet I didn&#x27;t notice it in the movie at
all. I&#x27;m not talking about some silly girly crush, but about the fact
that the movie never lets us see the characters eyes, the main tool for
an actor to express the emotions on screen.The CGI/prosthetic free part &#x96; let&#x27;s start with the opening prologue
which shows us the prince before the curse and how he deserved it.
While, ludicrously over-top, reeking with decadence, opulence and some
stupid grimacing on the Dan Stevens&#x27; part, it&#x27;s simultaneously
hauntingly effective about hour and half later. It&#x27;s hard to understand
at first, but until the transformation scene we never see prince&#x27;s real
face/appearance. He&#x27;s covered by the heavy, peacock style make up,
luxury clothes and over-indulgent wig. Just in case we didn&#x27;t get that
he&#x27;s a vain, cold-hearted jerk, not worthy our sympathy. (Subtlety, as
the singing, isn&#x27;t the strong side of the movie). Cut through the rest
of the movie till the transformation scene and unexpectedly I was
smitten by the delicacy of it. Not a word spoken. The human again
prince, in bewildered haze, turns to Belle and just stares at her,
deeply breathing, scared to make the first move. Suddenly, you can see
HIM. An absolutely changed person who &#x22;finally learned to love&#x22; . And
the interaction between them, how they touch each other and finally
kiss&#x85; The movie hits its famous tag line purpose without any special
effect, sophisticated dialog and special acting. For one little moment
I was blown away by the fairy tale come to life.But fear not, the next ending scenes successfully ruined the
impression. The great celebration ball -another opulent, tasteless and
overcrowded affair, just in brighter colors, and every peasant and
servant participates this time. The supposedly madly in love couple
barely registers somewhere in the middle of meaningless and polite
dance, where he barely kisses her hand once. And she makes a joke.
About him growing the beard! You see, him being stranded as a hideous
beast for years of despair and utter pain (supposedly, isn&#x27;t it?), now
is a matter of laughter, smirks and joking growl. Which brings me to
another, highly problematic issue, which wasn&#x27;t mentioned so far. There
isn&#x27;t any physical believable interaction between the beast/prince and
Belle. No buildup whatsoever. In the 1991 version you can constantly
see how the beast treasures each moment Belle is in his arms, how he
touches gently and playfully her hair when freeing her after the ball,
and giving her the mirror. Love is naturally very physical without
being vulgar and showy.Here, except in 2 scenes - the quite flat in itself ball dance and the
transformation scene I mentioned, it never happens. They walk and talk,
glancing at each other from time to time. At best, hold hands like 2
hippies after shared joint (the reunion scene when the pair emerges to
give some hugs to Lumier and Chip all of the sudden). I bet the 1991&#x27;s
cartoon didn&#x27;t had to spent that much money on showing us, in the final
scene, how deeply in love is the waltzing royal pair. They are the
epicenter and the heart of the tale. They can&#x27;t take their eyes of each
other, while everyone&#x27;s eyes are on them as well. Here? Nothing&#x85;Returning to the Mr. Stevens acting, I have to admit after all 2
important things. Unlike Watson, he knows how to move in period piece.
You should just watch the way she picks up the dish to drink from, and
the beast does the same after her, to understand what I mean.Second &#x96;the guy probably isn&#x27;t a great singer (it&#x27;s hard to understand
after auto tune and tinkering), like Josh Groban, yet he knows how to
sing the character song. While tampered by bad directing choice in the
movie (I didn&#x27;t understand until reading some comments in Youtube, that
all this weird jumping on the staircases was due to his desire to see
Belle as long as possible) his singing solo left enough impression on
me to go and check it on Youtube. Listening to it alone, via the
headset, with random images from movie before my eyes, it was nothing
less than revelation. I highly recommend you to listen yourself to Dan
Stevens&#x27;s version of Evermore on Youtube, close your eyes and imagine
the movie you&#x27;d like to see with it. Then you&#x27;ll understand why I
summed up my review by the quote from it - I&#x27;ll think of all that might
have been&#x85;
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Solid Live Action Adaptation - Good, not great<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Let&#x27;s face it if Disney is going to continue to line their pockets with
more cash by releasing live action versions of animations they better
be spectacular. This movie is well made and well acted but I wouldn&#x27;t
say spectacular. It&#x27;s a solid adaptation. I&#x27;m not sure about Emma
Watson as Belle. She&#x27;s an attractive woman who&#x27;s very talented but I
don&#x27;t think of her as beautiful. I get it, box office marquis names
aren&#x27;t always the best casting choices and she didn&#x27;t detract. One of
the best parts was Dan Stevens and the writers who gave depth to the
Beast and at least partially satisfied my questions about why Belle
would fall in love with him. Kevin Kline was solid as Belle&#x27;s Dad.
Gaston was the right casting choice Josh Gad was very funny as his
probably gay sidekick, LeFou. The music was above par and there were a
few new songs too. All in all a solid effort although a bit too long.
We&#x27;ve all seen the story so you won&#x27;t necessarily be astounded by the
live action version but you won&#x27;t dislike it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Like a mediocre enactment at Eurodisney at best<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The original was an undisputed masterpiece, and to top the artistry
with which it was hand-created by true artists is a potentially doomed
challenge. But when this live-action version got a great review in
Empire magazine we gave it a chance. About 10 minutes into the movie we felt like watching a Christmas
parade at Eurodisney with surprise celebrity appearances. Or an episode
of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. By then we knew the movie was doomed: The
colors, the over-polished and over-use of CGI (makeup would have
created a much more humane beast instead of this emotionless CGI one),
the mediocrity of the extra added songs, the pompous styling and the
obvious auto-tune on the voices by some director who&#x27;s clearly a
compulsive cleaner, allergic to even the smallest of human
imperfections. Take a song like Be Our Guest: In the original movie the
graphics transformed this great Menken/Ashman song into a next level
highlight. In the new version the song gets unnecessary extensions and
looks like Liberace just vomited all over it.The fact Disney expects us to applaud the fact they put their first gay
character in a movie in a time homosexuality is widely accepted is just
ridiculous: It&#x27;s long overdue, but to Disney also a clever marketing
tool to generate press. Bottom line: I guess even Disney isn&#x27;t perfect but after giving us next
level treats like Zootopia, Inside Out and Toy Story 3 I can forgive
them...
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It&#x27;s fine...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was pretty excited for this film when I heard it announced. I am a
big fan of the original and I couldn&#x27;t wait to see a new take on the
classic story. I was finally able to watch it a couple of days ago. And
I thought it was fine. I believe it is a fun film to watch and I&#x27;m glad
I saw it. However, unlike the remake of The Jungle Book, the original
animated version is better in my opinion. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cast
are all fantastic especially Emma Watson, Luke Evans, and Ian McKellen.
And watching Be Our Guest performed in live action was spectacular. But
I believe the the 1991 version executed some the scenes better than
this remake did. Three scenes come to mind. The scene in which Belle
take her father&#x27;s place in the castle. This entire scene felt rather
rushed for me, and in the animated version I really believe that Belle
is absolutely terrified of the Beast. In the live action version
however, the Beast coming into the light seems to be glanced over. The
scene where the Beast tries and fails to ask Belle to dinner for the
first time. In the original, the Beast totally looses it when Belle
refuses to come to dinner. In the remake, he seems angry, but not
absolutely enraged. And the scene in which Belle goes into the West
Wing against instructions. In the animated version, the West Wing is
built up very mysteriously and when Belle does eventually wander in
there, she takes the lid off the enchanted rose, and this is the main
reason the Beast gets so angry with her. In the remake, Belle doesn&#x27;t
even take the lid off. However, I didn&#x27;t hate the remake, I just prefer
the original. If you gave me the option of which one I would want to
watch on movie night, I would pick the 1991 classic in a heartbeat.

Maybe if this was released in 1991 it would have been a smash hit. Oh
wait, it was.A selfish prince is cursed into the form of a beast, and his castle&#x27;s
servants turned into animate objects, but when a girl enters the castle
looking for her lost father, there is hope to lift the curse.Disney&#x27;s insistence to churn out these live-action remakes of their
most popular animated features is proving extremely divisive, but they
really do bring in the money.People do take comfort in the familiar&#x85;I feel bad for children who might experience this interpretation of the
story first, and it gives evidence of exactly what&#x27;s wrong with
remaking things. Especially when the original is a priceless gem with
little to no flaws. Disney, and director Bill Condon, clearly knew &#x22;if
it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&#x22;. Indeed, Condon has literally remade
Beauty and the Beast, only not as well. Congratulations? 2017&#x27;s film
benefits, like a leech, on the memories of the original movie. To like
this movie is to reaffirm love for the original: Oh, this song! I love
this song. I refuse to recognise they have replaced a talented Broadway
singer for an auto-tuned Emma Watson. Oh, I love this opening song in
the village. Oh, because it is shot-for-shot exactly the same as the
original?Sure, okay, die hard fans will lap this up. You can let it wash over
you and make you all nostalgic for a faultless Academy Award winning
Disney film that still exists. There are improvements. Such as Kevin
Kline as Belle&#x27;s father Maurice, Josh Gad (as a decidedly subtle
homosexual LeFou, calm down people) and the introduction of the film
are good choices. But these are only good because they buck the film&#x27;s
dogged insistence on following the original&#x27;s personality exactly. The
ending too is surprisingly darker (yet without changing anything). But
for everything good, there&#x27;s plenty wrong. Primarily is one new
addition to the plot. The Enchantress that cursed the prince, asides
from giving him the magic mirror to show him the outside world to
torment him also gives him a magic book. A book that allows the one
holding the book to teleport anywhere in the world. This becomes a
expositionary device, which I was okay with. But later when Belle is
forced to flee the castle to rescue her father (as the original plot
demands) in such as hurry as to not change from her ballroom dress, she
rides off on her horse. Desperate and maybe too late! &#x85; You have a book
that can literally take you there instantaneously.There are many other issues, but none as apparent and seemingly
narrow-minded as that. It usually boils down to pacing and screenplay
structure, which simply aren&#x27;t as tight as the original, dragging
scenes out with padding. A couple of extra songs that reek of &#x22;we
haven&#x27;t had a song in a while&#x22;. Or surreal moments with Belle or
Beast&#x27;s internalisations about one another (in the original) now being
sung aloud when in blatant earshot of each other? What?No, the sets aren&#x27;t bad and are lavishly detailed, the servants designs
are intricate and creative, the idea that the castle is crumpling as
the rose wilts is great. But everything feels so passionless and empty,
following the stage directions of an existing classic to the letter. A
film that takes a cherished and award worthy experience and thinks it
can do better, without doing anything new with it and simply running
with people&#x27;s nostalgia.

Just went to see Disney&#x27;s latest &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;, which was
recommended by everyone from the conductor at our last orchestra
rehearsal to the greengrocer, and was very disappointed :-(Most of the film ranged from mediocre to downright annoying -- I don&#x27;t
know how I would have reacted if I hadn&#x27;t been mentally comparing it to
the animated version of which this was an adaptation, but in comparison
with its predecessor I felt it came off very badly. The opening scene
wasn&#x27;t too bad as a fleshed-out live-action version of something that
was heavily stylised in the first place, but as soon as we got to
&#x22;Bonjour!&#x22; my heart sank. The busy town scene that was so full of life
in its caricatured version was neither realistic nor convincingly
stylised. Emma Watson in her liberated modern costumes looked
completely out of place (which was only emphasised by the screenplay&#x27;s
attempts to explain this away by telling us that she was ahead of her
time), and I felt that an air of nastiness had crept in to both sides
of the equation. Belle doesn&#x27;t just find her home provincial, she
scorns it as oppressive; her neighbours don&#x27;t just see her as a dreamy
odd girl, they see her as a dangerous subversive. The days of
fairy-tale are over; this film comes across as trying to sell a message
-- pump a brand -- create &#x27;Disney princess&#x27; material (with all its
post-&#x27;Frozen&#x27; overlays of girl power and empowerment) -- in a way that
the original never did.I remember that sequence where Belle runs out onto the streaming grass
of the hill-top and sings of her longing for &#x22;the great wide somewhere&#x22;
away from the cheerful, well-meaning domestic preoccupations of her
neighbours as being the great &#x27;lift-off&#x27; moment of the animated
version; it spoke to everything that I was and everything I hoped for.
Here -- not at all aided by the obvious fake &#x27;reality&#x27; of the flowers
and scenery -- the presentation of it felt thoroughly manipulative and
left me unmoved and resentful; that was the moment at which it first
began to dawn on me that I might actually come to dislike this version
:-(Feminist Belle turns out to be... inadvertently annoying. Quite a lot
of things about this film were annoying, not least its habit of trying
far too hard to patch perceived plot holes and deficiencies in its
characters by adding vast amounts of laboured backstory. (All that we
really needed to know about Belle&#x27;s missing mother, for instance, was
conveyed in the single silent shot of her father at work beneath the
painting of his wife and child.) &#x22;Tries far too hard&#x22; sums it up,
really.The one plot issue that I did feel needed addressing in the original
was the improbable timescale of the idea that the Prince had to break
the spell before his twenty-first birthday -- instead of trying to
explain this one away, very wisely they silently drop the reference.
And the additions I enjoyed were the added characters of the musical
wardrobe and piano, plus the idea that the characters are not merely
doomed to remain cursed, but will become items of furniture for real if
it goes on too long. (Although having a lengthy would-be weepy sequence
at the end where not only does the Beast actually die -- before being
resurrected by the Dea ex Machina -- but all the other characters
effectively perish, as well, was a case of over-egging the pudding,
which this film does all too often.)Cogsworth very much seems to get the thin end of the stick in this
version, I felt -- in the original, I remember him as a by-the-book
stickler of an English butler figure, but with unsuspected moments of
dignity and heroism. Here he&#x27;s basically the cowardly comic relief who
is always on the wrong side of every disagreement, and the ending is
soured with yet another laugh at his expense when he is restored to the
arms of his unpleasant wife.And while most people who disliked the film seemed to mention the
character of Gaston as its one saving grace, I disliked Gaston as
well... and not in the enjoyable way you were meant to dislike him :-(
The original is handsome, conceited, talented in his own sphere,
genuinely convinced that he is the best thing ever to happen to Belle
and quite unable to understand why she can&#x27;t see it. This version, who
deliberately kicks mud over the girls who admire him and often seems to
need talking down from a psychotic fit, comes across as rather less
blindly self-centred and more coldly narcissistic. The original Gaston
genuinely didn&#x27;t seem to understand this unprecedented failure of his
charms; this one is a sadist who actively prefers hunting down
reluctant &#x27;prey&#x27;. In trying (I think) to give him more psychological
depth, they&#x27;ve removed the casual swagger of the original and the
necessary charisma that would explain why people follow and adore him;
he becomes simply nasty from the start.I had no particular objection to Disney&#x27;s live-action remake of their
&#x22;Cinderella&#x22;, possibly because I barely even knew the original; I saw
the remake and quite liked it. With this one they took on the much more
risky task of remaking something that was a hit in its own right to
begin with, thus giving themselves a much higher bar to pass. (There&#x27;s
an aphorism that it takes a bad book to make a great movie -- something
similar may apply to remakes...) The constant over-the-top urge to
provide explanations and reinterpretations for every detail of the
original by and large just doesn&#x27;t work.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Stick with the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
OK, so the animated 1991 version is my childhood. Some of my fondest
memories ever, is watching the VHS tape with my younger brother. So,
maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have gone to see this remake, but I felt &#x22;I have to,
I mean how bad can it be?&#x22;In all fairness, it wasn&#x27;t horrible. But, if it urges me to write my
first review here, it&#x27;s not good. First of all, I liked Emma Watson more than I thought I would. The
surroundings were very pretty, Luke Evans did a good job as Gaston,
some of the new songs were quite nice, but that&#x27;s about it.I was really excited about the supporting cast, I mean it&#x27;s Kevin
Kline, Emma Thompson, Ian McKellen etc. But they didn&#x27;t do much for me. I appreciate that they wanted to embellish the story and the musical
numbers, but they just tried to hard. I didn&#x27;t like the new
arrangements in the music, they changed too much for no reason. I was underwhelmed by the CGI, I expected more from that hefty budget. I really disliked the way they did the ending. When the beast is
&#x22;dying&#x22; and Belle is by his side, it&#x27;s the most gripping moment in the
original. In this one, we see him and Belle, she is crying, I am
tearing up, and then...they CUT AWAY. We all of a sudden see Lumiere
and Cogsworth and the rest of the &#x22;household staff&#x22; coming to life, and
then they come back to Belle and the beast and she tells him that she
loves him. Totally anticlimactic. I lost all emotion, and I just don&#x27;t
understand why they did that.When the beast is finally himself again, we see them dancing, and all
of sudden, in this romantic scene, they feel the need to add a joke.
Belle says something like &#x22;How would you feel about growing a beard?&#x22;.
Totally uncalled for. The ending was just nowhere near the original in it&#x27;s emotion, beauty
and grandness, and the same goes for the movie as a whole.Stick with the original, that&#x27;s all I can say.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney, would you please do the same trick you did with Moana when casting your live-action films?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I might be one of the very few people out there who don&#x27;t like, and
have never liked, the original Beauty and the Beast movie. I never got
beyond the creepiness of the premise that an apparently smart,
rebellious girl falls in love with a ghastly bad-tempered hairy bull
who almost starves her dad to death and keeps her prisoner in his big
old castle, which is not as bad as a basement, but doesn&#x27;t stray too
far. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good story for children, or for anyone for
that matter (a much better version of the story is presented in George
Lukas&#x27; animated movie Strange Magic, but since everybody hates Lukas
now, everybody seems to hate that film too). With that said, the
visuals in the film were finely executed, the cups and kettles were
amusing, and the soundtrack was simply beautiful.The new film doesn&#x27;t have even those things. In fact, the trailer was
enough to show that Beast belongs to some of the worst CGI characters
out there in this day and age, and Emma Watson looks nothing like
quirky, lively Belle. And oh boy, what&#x27;s about this fashion with
forcing famous but tone-deaf actors to sing? They could hire someone
else to do vocals for them. Because if you make a film that expensive,
and especially a remake of a classical musical, you could at least
ensure the soundtrack is digestible.Or they could simply find someone who can both fit the role AND sing,
and not someone overpaid, overrated, and almost ten years older than
the prototype. I believe it could have been great if they&#x27;d look for
new talents for the live action remakes the same way they looked for a
girl to voice the title character in Moana. They found a perfect match
- a talented new thing with awesome vocal chops, a real embodiment of
the character who actually did her best to excel in the role.But hey, poor Emma isn&#x27;t by far the only reason the movie is awful. The
new Cinderella remake, also a pretty bland and useless effort, at least
looked stunning, a true fairy-tale come to life. Here we got a
cardboard town, a fake monster, and a set of cutlery so creepy they&#x27;d
fit much better in one of the worse Tim Burton&#x27;s movies. Why remaking a
film shot-by-shot when you ruin every shot? The verdict - a creepy tale told in a creepy and sloppy fashion with
the sole purpose to get your hard-earned cash our of your pockets,
giving nothing in return. Take your kids elsewhere.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Did we really need this?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
OK, let&#x27;s get the gay thing out of the way first: it was horribly
forced and awkward.Remember &#x22;Victor Victoria&#x22;? Anyone? For the few that remember what a
GOOD movie is like, everyone in that film BELONGED in that film.The gay character here is present because political correctness and
diversity. That&#x27;s all.A lesson to all: when you shove something into a decidedly
non-political movie for the sake of your ideology even when it should
be clear it doesn&#x27;t fit, you ruin it. This goes for &#x27;Christian&#x27; and any
other philosophies as well. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR STORY. Nothing else
matters.As for the rest... it&#x27;s just... there. Despite being &#x27;live-action&#x27; it
feels flatter than the 2D animated original. The story goes through the
motions and achieves nothing more. I&#x27;d rather watch the animated
version again.I fear this is also going to be the case with the retold &#x22;Lion King&#x22;
Disney is planning. As with this movie, I feel most people are going to
look at these over-expensive CGI effect fests and conclude as I do:
other than nostalgia-driven cash grabs, what&#x27;s the point?
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Flat and kitschy<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Oh man, I really wanted to like this movie. I&#x27;m a die-hard Disney fan
and Beauty and the Beast is by far my favorite, I know it like the back
of my hand having watched it a hundred times. It was really Disney&#x27;s
masterpiece. I went with a group of five 6-12 year old girls and we had
made it a pretty big event...the little girl in me was SO PUMPED.As much as I love Emma Watson, she was sorely miscast in this
adaptation. Really all I could see was Hermione popping through
constantly. I love her quirks, but they didn&#x27;t come off as Belle&#x27;s
strange, feisty quirkiness. Really in the opening scene in the village,
nothing about her came off as &#x22;strange&#x22; at all even though the
townspeople are singing about how strange she is. Actually she seemed
normal and THEY seemed strange. And while she can sing to an extent, it
lacked Paige O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s richness and emotion. And the odd delays in
between the words in the song lyrics drove me absolutely insane. I&#x27;m
all for making a classic song new, but the original is hard to top as
it is and the little changes that were made almost seemed to make fun
of it. If you can&#x27;t make it better, then stick to the meter and timing
of the original at least and don&#x27;t try to change it at all. The crowd-
supported parts of the songs were the best because they stayed the
truest.The CGI I felt was actually pretty good, but the character design was
Just. So. Weird. They didn&#x27;t have to look like the original characters
but they didn&#x27;t have to look creepy... I guess when you need to make an
actual object come alive, maybe there&#x27;s really no way to do with
WITHOUT some creepiness. Beast&#x27;s design really just didn&#x27;t do it for me
but it wasn&#x27;t entirely awful. Really it was his lines and demeanor that
ruined it for me. The voice acting in the original was full of emotion
and granted you can draw a character to have any facial expression and
emotion you want....but is it really so difficult to find actors that
can do the same? Emma is beautiful of course but she isn&#x27;t Belle, just
like Dan Stevens is a great actor but he&#x27;s not Beast. Rachel McAdams or
Natalie Portman, while older than Belle&#x27;s character, both could have
fit this role and have the look. I&#x27;d have picked someone like Bradley
Cooper for the Beast...again older than Beast&#x27;s character but he still
has that ruggedness and boyishness about him.It wasn&#x27;t so much the CGI that bothered me but the flat and awkward
line delivery. It didn&#x27;t feel natural, it didn&#x27;t feel emotive. Actually
the whole movie felt just really really awkward. I thought maybe the
ending might make up for it, I had really hoped for that heart
wrenching roar the beast lets out as Belle is riding away that would
defibrillate some life back into it, but instead he sang an awkward
song which may or may not have been part of the original Broadway play?
Look your girl is riding off and you&#x27;re doomed to remain a beast. That
warrants a roar, not a song. Okay, maybe the transformation scene would
change things....it started off riveting and promising....but then when
he lands on his feet (instead of a dramatic &#x22;dead&#x22; crumple, only to
heave a new breath of life and rise up again) he just has this dopey
and ridiculous look on his face. I actually laughed out loud.LeFou was great. Controversial maybe, but seriously it was so subtle
that it&#x27;s going to fly over the head of anyone under the age of 11. I
can&#x27;t think of anyone better to play him really, and even Luke Evans as
Gaston was mildly entertaining. The Kill the Beast number was the best
of all of them, really. The final dancing scene was really beautiful. Belle&#x27;s dress and the
roses on everyone&#x27;s costumes was a nice touch.I don&#x27;t know. It felt forced and uncomfortable. It felt more like a
high school play. My 6- year old enjoyed it and that&#x27;s what matters,
but in the end the original is by far superior.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just stick with the original &#x27;90s Disney movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I was left thinking &#x22;What was the
bloody point?&#x22; and came out feeling underwhelmed as everything felt
weaker compared to the 1991 original. Emma Watson is not very good as
Belle, and they didn&#x27;t change it enough to make it stand out like The
Jungle Book or Pete&#x27;s Dragon remake. Disney felt really lazy here,
sadly. I hope we see more effort in the future rather than just 90% the
exact same movie.4.5/10

In a world... where originality and creativity has gone down the
drain... (because of too many mushrooms and weed smoked) even the
mighty Disney empire has been plagued by mediocre and sub-mediocre
unintelligent people who decided to put their few neurons to work - and
created this utter nonsensical useless boring dull uninspired (and very
much expired) piece of sh**. So they chose an actress who had relations
up there - because this is how things often worked in Hollywood - but
in spite of their efforts to auto-tune her voice and dress her in
colorful stuff, she still damaged the image of the original Belle of
Disney. A broomstick up her a$$, her reactions were so much more
unemotional than those of the petrified castle servants... &#x26; the beast?
absolutely horrendous to watch, also pretty much wooden... and an
insult to the original cartoon of 1991 WHO STILL REMAINS ONE OF DISNEY&#x27;S MASTERPIECES(from a time when the minds and hearts of people making movies there
were less affected by darkness).It&#x27;s best to revisit the old masterpieces. I am afraid of how the
future rehashes will look...

I own 463 3D blu-rays and this is easily the best movie in my

is much better in every category. The costumes and sets were
beautifully rendered, Emma Watson is adorable as Belle, the music is
gorgeously orchestrated and every singer is top notch! The 3D is
&#x22;medium-strong&#x22; to &#x22;strong&#x22; and is very consistent. Not many pop-outs
but multiple layers and plenty of depth. The colours REALLY pop on my
4K OLED and everything has so much detail! This movie adds additional
depth to the storyline and character development and even adds some new
songs which I really enjoyed. I laughed.. I cried... I danced (in my

ballroom dance yellow dress, and her singing is fantastic- They threw in new additional songs/soundtrack in the movie, but they
were all EASILY FORGETTABLE and POOR! It sounds soooo generic and not
catchy at all... did not want to listen to those singing parts; the
original songs were instantly catchy and what made them all classic,
regardless of the the nostalgia factor. Seriously, all the new songs
stink, very uninspiring, plain and uncreative. - The beast CG is soooo bad. They should have just went with a physical
makeup artist. I mean, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve advanced in the physical makeup
department. It seems like we&#x27;re stepping backwards in CG quality. The
beast also isn&#x27;t as charming/memorable/likable change as the original. - The chemistry between Belle and the Beast just isn&#x27;t there like the
animation.- While some of the &#x22;twist&#x22;/new elements they changed around with the
scenes with Gaston were interesting, the extra backstory they threw in
about the mother and Paris is so bad. - Gaston doesn&#x27;t seem that much of a jerk in the beginning. Where&#x27;s the
muscles and him gulping bunch of eggs?!- The best scene is the iconic ballroom dance. Emma Watson looks so
beautiful there and that iconic Beauty and Beast music just sends you
chills. The sets and everything makes this really magical. - The ending Ariana Grande/John Legend version isn&#x27;t that good... the
version they used in the trailer is waaayy better and sounds more epic.
Also Celine Dion&#x27;s &#x22;How Does A Moment Last Forever&#x22; isn&#x27;t that great
either. First of all, the whole &#x22;gay scene&#x22; controversy is totally overblown
and ridiculous; did I miss something? It&#x27;s honestly not there. There&#x27;s
more direct blatant sex on TV and ads daily all the time, yet there&#x27;s
actually people complaining or spreading this silly false propaganda of
a &#x22;gay scene&#x22;?And another thing, what the hell are people complaining about Emma
Watson&#x27;s singing? So hard to please people. Yet another ridiculous
controversy rumor floating around about &#x22;auto-tune&#x22; is another
overblown false accusation. Haters are just always haters. Emma is an
amazing singer and has a wonderful voice... Jealous, crazy people out
there.The first scene when Belle talks to her father, she bends over way too
many times... that seemed almost too deliberate and calculated. Josh Gad as Gaston&#x27;s side kick is spot on. It&#x27;s very risky and hard to
top a classic legendary film, you can&#x27;t expect this to surpass the
original - I mean, nothing is going to take away the original anyway.
Obviously it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s still a nice addition. I enjoyed
the set, hearing the classic songs again, totally didn&#x27;t care for the
new songs/new backstory - but it was still a magical experience.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Unnecessary remake of a classic animated movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really looked forward to the release of this movie. I really thought
the cast was going to make it great, but I was so disappointed.This live action movie adds some backstory to the beast, which I
welcomed. Then it adds backstory to Belle, which I thought was
unnecessary. For the most part, the new version follows the same story
as the animated one, but does so in a very slow manner. Some of the
original songs, who are great, keep being lengthened or interrupted.
The movie ends up being too long with serious pacing problems.Add to that some low quality/creepy CGI, new songs that come out dull
and out of place, poor acting (most of all from Emma Watson, who seems
not to react to anything that is going on, especially when the beast is
under attack), political correctness (reach your own conclusions here),
and a weak Gaston (yes, instead of a self confident man, we see a timid
sheep when around Belle). All of that makes for a poor remake.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>So much potential yet so unfulfilling<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I REALLY wanted to love this movie. Admittedly, I love Disney. Yep, one
of those wackos that braves thousands of like-minded folk stuffed into
a square mile, fighting for a glimpse of Mickey as he rides by on his
majestic parade float. So it&#x27;s easy to see that I was anticipating this
release, but with cautious optimism.Sadly, some of my fears were eventually realized. Overall, the movie
seems very uninspired, if I had to sum it up into one word. The
characters at times seem shallow. Emma Watson, although a wonderful
actress, is no Belle. Disney clearly has a vision for each of their
characters and that vision is very recognizable throughout the world of
Disney, in the parks, cartoons, books, etc. Watson is definitely a
liberty that the producer took with this film and I personally think it
was a mistake.Beast is kind of a mess. I actually enjoyed the backstory but didn&#x27;t
feel that the movie dug deep enough into Beast&#x27;s change of heart.
Almost as if one day, he woke up on the other side of the bed.I would have like to seen Maurice as a little more absent-minded,
almost where one might think of him as potentially crazy. Here again,
he seems like an afterthought. If it weren&#x27;t for his hair, the name
&#x22;crazy Maurice&#x22; wouldn&#x27;t even make sense.And Gaston...where do I start? I love Gaston in the story, but hated
him in this movie. Gaston isn&#x27;t supposed to be realized as an
antagonist until midway through the story. Here, he&#x27;s clearly a jerk
from the start and seemingly obsessed with marriage. He&#x27;s supposed to
be funny, if not annoying at times. Like a puppy dog chasing a bone.However, I enjoyed the music and some of the animation. And as
expected, Josh Gad was a bright spot.

Here&#x27;s The Lowedown on &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; (PG - 2017 -
US/UK)...&#x22;How would you feel about growing a beard?&#x22;Genre: Fantasy/MusicalMy Score: 8.1Cast=9 Acting=7 Plot=8 Ending=8 Story=7 CGI=10 Pace=6 Fantasy=10
Musical=8 Family=8A young prince, imprisoned in the form of a beast, can be freed only by
true love. What may be his only opportunity arrives when he meets
Belle, the only human girl to ever visit the castle since it was
enchanted. &#x22;It&#x27;s the ones who play hard to get that are always the sweetest prey.&#x22;
Putting my searing hatred for musicals aside, I liked the film!! great
CGI...than they started singing. Loved Emma Watson, Kevin Kline, and
Luke Evans in their roles...then they started singing. It has all the
elements you would want in the live action remake...if they hadn&#x27;t have
cut out the best line from the only song I liked from the animated film
the score might be different. I hate musicals, but I was able to make
it through.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Incredibly Disappointing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I am aware that I am writing this long after this film came out but I
had to think about it after I saw it. No it&#x27;s not because the movie is
brilliant it&#x27;s actually because this movie is incredibly average. Every
time I found something good about the movie I found something equally
as bad. For example: The sets are very well done and nice to look at,
the detail is truly astounding then I notice that the cgi looks truly
horrendous. As for the original if I&#x27;m being honest I never saw it but
I will see it soon. I went in with brand new eyes not knowing what
would happen and it was a massive disappointment. It was getting all
these good reviews and I know some people who really liked it when it
came out. I for one hated Maleficent and The Jungle Book remakes and I
was to bored to finish the Cinderella one (I have heard it&#x27;s the best
one). But I would have never seen this movie if it hadn&#x27;t been for the
reviews. So if you like movies such as Cinderella (2015) or The Jungle
Book (2016) then just go see it, you&#x27;ll probably love it. But if you
thought those other films were lazy cash grabs then don&#x27;t see it.
Because of how lazy it truly is I gave it a 4/10 instead of a 5/10. As for the actually film there really isn&#x27;t much to talk about. Emma
Watson looked that part but didn&#x27;t really emote very well plus here
singing is awful. Some people might say &#x22;Well Emma Stone in La La Land
(a much better movie) didn&#x27;t sing the best but you gave that movie a
ten&#x22;, well that movie isn&#x27;t a typical musical and doesn&#x27;t have larger
then life characters. They&#x27;re just normal people who do normal things
it would be weird to see them have fantastic singing voices. But as for
this film the characters are larger then life. You see in older
musically the characters are very one note but they are extremely
exaggerated. So they need exaggerated big voices. When there were
singers who were actually good at singing (Audra McDonald) they are
wasted and worse singers (Emma Watson, Emma Thompson) are used more and
sometimes my ears were close to bleeding and I was close to laughing
out load in the theater when I first heard Emma Watson.As for the plot and characters i never found it to interesting and even
though I haven&#x27;t seen the original I still predicted everything that
would happen. There really isn&#x27;t to much to talk about though it&#x27;s just
a bland disappointing movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Another good Disney work...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It is very difficult to remake an animated movie! Really difficult!
Because you can not represent the magic of the animations! Maleficent
was blamed for reconstructing and altering the plot of the original
movie. Disney learned its lesson and this doesn&#x27;t happen in Beauty and
the Beast! Maybe the actors&#x27; performance is not the best, but it&#x27;s not
bad either. Also, very good effects-cgi and very good taste of humor in
many scenes! And last but not least romance was everywhere in the
atmosphere!I caught many times myself moved remembering my childhood years while
watching the movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Good, But Not Great Remake<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It&#x27;s a tale as old as time...and this &#x22;live action&#x22; remake of the
beloved animated &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; from 1991 wants desperately to
pay homage to the original while adding its own spin. I will say up
front that I loved the original and even owned the CD of the Broadway
musical it spawned years later. This movie pulls from both as well as
the original story. Does it work? At times. I will break down this
review in three sections: Casting, music, and direction. Casting:
Seeing as I&#x27;m not really a Harry Potter fan, I can&#x27;t say I was all that
ecstatic with the casting of Emma Watson. The movie didn&#x27;t change my
mind much. She sang well, but didn&#x27;t do much else for me. Even her
musical numbers felt flat with little expression on her face or in her
body. Kevin Kline was excellent as her father Maurice even though his
part felt limited. The real star of this movie was Luke Evans as
Gaston. He was having so much fun and ate up every scene. The rest of
the top-notch cast were fine with what they had to work with. Music:
All of your favorites from the original are here (&#x22;Belle&#x22;, &#x22;Be Our
Guest&#x22;, &#x22;Gaston&#x22;, etc) and a few new songs added as well. I enjoyed
some of the new lyrics and arrangements that were added to the original
songs. Nothing was taken away from them, which was good. The new songs
were okay, but none will be as memorable as the originals. Direction:
Bill Condon is no stranger to bringing musicals to the big screen as he
previously directed &#x22;Dreamgirls&#x22; as well as &#x22;Chicago&#x22;. So it&#x27;s no
surprise that this movie feels much more like watching a Broadway show
than sitting in s movie theater. (One of my friends said the guy next
to him would applaud after each musical number) The big musical numbers
(&#x22;Belle&#x22;, &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;, and &#x22;Gaston&#x22;) were grand with extravagant
visual effects and fun extras. Unfortunately Mr. Condon still struggles
with is good CGI (he also directed the last two &#x22;Twilight&#x22; movies. For
this to be &#x22;live action&#x22; just about every scene was computer animated
in some way (and was blatantly noticeable). The beast, nor the
household items, ever had much real expression. The backgrounds were
clearly green- screened (George Lucas would be so proud). And the final
scenes at the castle were so dark, you could barely make out what was
happening between the beast and Gaston. The last thing I will mention
is I would not recommend this to young children. I&#x27;m sure there are
plenty of little girls (let&#x27;s just say 10 and under) who love the
cartoon are going to want to see it. But it&#x27;s too long (over 2 hours)
and at times can be too scary. My 7 year old got bored about halfway
through. Several other young movie- goers in the theater seemed to lose
interest at times as well. Overall, it was good but not great. I hope
they do better with &#x22;The Lion King&#x22;.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Must Walt Disney Studios Redraw Its Future?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney presides over the current film scene in terms of money and art.
The company founded by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks benefits from film
studios with higher profitability on the market, which are the owner of
retributive franchises such as &#x22;Star Wars,&#x22; &#x22;Indiana Jones&#x22;, Pixar
Animation Studios&#x27; works and the complete universe of Marvel Comics.
The money amount it earns periodically with each of its proposals is
unheard-of, either original ideas, those that turn to imagination
without employing creative precedents, or remakes, audiovisual
productions reproduces the narrative thread, the atmosphere in which
the story runs, characters, and even pre-existing songs, in this case,
from unreproducible animated classics.For a person who loves and
understands film substance, it&#x27;s dishonorable and enervating to see how
celluloid world isn&#x27;t being handled by creative artists, but by
financial managers and accountants presiding artificial productions at
box-office designs&#x27; expense, shelving true meaning of cinema. An
archetype of this is the hybrid that I mentioned earlier,
etymologically known as live- action. Hollywood executive&#x27;s greed is
derisory, greediness brazenly covers up under the shadow of
hypothetical homages or reinventions for the audiences of the 20th
century, those who have not had the opportunity to familiarize yourself
with the likable unalterable animated characters and stories. However,
we cannot declare that live-action feature films presented are strictly
a way to make money, this is the hidden purpose, the released guinea
pigs have been reasonably great. So this is where the final questioning
emerges: must we pass unnoticed Disney&#x27;s money desires if and only if
it remains to offer audiovisual productions entirely well made, even if
they continue to nurture the plague producing creative shortcomings
nowadays? Judge for yourselves. Imaginative impasse&#x27;s last prey is &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;, Disney&#x27;s
first movie in being nominated in six different categories at the
Academy Awards, of which won two awards with reference to its
unforgettable OST.The reinterpretation of the story of a prince
transfigured int beast because of his arrogant conceit and his
corresponding love affair with a villager who arrives his castle to
rescue her father, examining enormous expectation set up months ago, is
a modern contraption artistically uneven, it fulfills the objective of
evoking the amazing inspiration source, at the same time develops more
complex stories and plausible motivations, but using an almost integral
copy. Although there&#x27;s a patent female empowerment message, an
unjustified noise for the first homosexual character of the company and
places as meticulous as magnificent, it looks as if narrative were in
unripe, and I don&#x27;t mean the tale itself, since we already know it
fully, I say this for autonomy lack with the basic story.William &#x22;Bill&#x22; Condon (&#x22;Dreamgirls&#x22; &#x26; &#x22;Mr. Holmes&#x22;) does what he can
with the tools on his property. We&#x27;ve had the pleasure of knowing Mr.
Condon&#x27;s aptitudes in sharply human films, the filmmaker exhibited his
sensitive eye to portray fables with a dramatic base in these ones. The
director will make to resurface briefly the charm of years ago with
almost emulated camera shots, only altered by indescribable
technological advances, however, the real magic keeps in the adorable
animation from the 90s. The dance scene, &#x27;Be Our Guest&#x27; musical number
and the terminal moment will stimulate the awakening of memories
supported by no ideal love and inner beauty, besides the rewarding
minor variations to the soundtrack. Such immoderate fidelity allows it
to touch both glory and failure at the same time. A recreation with
less interest in the most circumstances, perhaps, it would have been
better to get away from the original material a little more, just as
Christophe Gans&#x27; dismal adaptation.In respect of visual part, they had a laborious and delicate job, erect
rightly Villeneuve, beast&#x27;s gloomy palace or the tavern where LeFoe
adulates Gaston with a song or make with extreme delicacy characters
attire weren&#x27;t easy. The filmmaking is objectively its specialty,
keeping in mind narrative standards raised previously. Although Rococo
style, CGI animations and clothing and make-up are fetching, that too
dark effect prevailing in the third act is neither pleasant nor
required. Fortunately, such chromatic attenuation doesn&#x27;t discredit
Belle&#x27;s stunning yellow dress, the design of the sets and its animated
characters or Emma Watson paying homage to &#x22;Mary Poppins&#x22; with her
musical scene. Beautiful pictures.If it had optimal challenges graphically, musically was impossible to
get even an infinitesimal improvement, and effectively, impossible is
impossible. Despite original composer (Alan Menken) returned to provide
his services, none of his new scores are entirely predominant, however,
the interpretation of the music classic in the voices of Ariana Grande
and John Legend recalls melodic beauty from the original song.The classic movie will remain a classic, but what would be a true
modern classic falls short in charm. Exhausting run-time, Watson&#x27;s
overvaluation, the CGI technique in the face of the Beast of doubtful
credibility, exaggerated darkness in the third act, and a few new
forgettable songs complicate the goals of Disney about its winning
streak. I&#x27;ve rated the film with reference to the original movie, since
although they didn&#x27;t want to alter or pass inspiration source, their
attempt stays in a lax reinterpretation, as if Condon and his team
wanted to draw frame by frame with beautiful elements which don&#x27;t find
who make them shine, and although in matter of adaptations, respectful
similarity is what must prevail, it lacks magic. &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;
(2017) is far from being a bad movie, nevertheless, they knew what and
who they faced, and evidently failed to convince so big beasts.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I Yearned To Enjoy This<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Honestly I just finished watching this at home June 6, 2017 as it came
out on DVD to rent and/or sell today ..... and I am left with the same
feelings ..... it could have been so much better IF ( a big if and in
my opinion ) the two main lead characters had been chosen more
carefully and had actually wanted to lead the story. Please keep in
mind I am a fan of the 1991 version as that is also my birth year, but
disregarding that version and taking this film all on its own; I was
still perplexed in not a good way by the end of watching this a second
time through ( my first had been in the theater ). Even so Belle&#x27;s
(Watson) voice was so crazy auto tuned it literally nearly ruined my
concentration and honestly I found the Beast character to be flat as
well; both seemed to be truly aiming to help us ( the audience )
understand that they came to do a stage play..... not a film that much
was felt by myself. The supporting actors ( the live talking house hold
objects ), ( Gaston and his side kick ), ( the towns people ) &#x3E;ALL&#x3C;
projected and emoted So much more convincingly than the two main leads
in this 2017 remake of the 1991 classic. They &#x3E;ALL&#x3C; appeared and
carried themselves and their voices as if they came to do their jobs
above and beyond what&#x27;s on the manuscript. I admit there are additional
scenes in this live-action remake that add nice story filler and
contribute to the bulk of the storyline that simply was missing from
the 1991 animated version...... but that DID NOT Salvage this film on
the whole from this epic train wreck. Truth be told IF I ignore these few and albeit startling obviously
obnoxious glaring annoyances from the minute of the opening frame until
the glitzy spaz of an ending...... I can admit it is somewhat a
nostalgic feeling to see this live-action version but; IF Only ......
IF Only the lead two main leads had not been so utterly flat lined in
how they delivered their individual performances and even together it
seemed they had zero chemistry on each scene no matter the situation
within the film. I can personally swallow all the flashy displays of costumes and over
dressed up sets, the CG was passable and it seemed they did try to make
it glamorous and enchanting which it was, but what wrecked the ballroom
scene for me was how pitiful and flat and plain the Belle dress
was!!!!! I mean really it was plain and I could assume budget cuts?
That yellow dress on Belle is a statement piece of the character and
yet I was left with my mouth hanging open in utter dismay and
bewildered astonishment upon seeing it for a second time; I was
grotesquely underwhelmed. {Trying desperately not to compare it to the
1991 version but BUT)....... The 1991 yellow dress on Belle was just
that a gorgeous gown and the character wore NO jewelry or many
accessories...... the dress was the main event and even on a animated
character it SHOWED CLEARLY! This 2017 version of that yellow gown left
me sad and unimpressed to say the least. Buttttttttttt ......... overall I wish Disney had tried much harder to
put out a film worth watching ( and no I do not want a cookie cutter
version of the 1991 version ) but I truly enjoyed Maleficent and
Cinderella and Jungle Book ......... Why Oh Why is this Beauty &#x26; The
Beast 2017 lacking? While remakes prior to it are seemingly more
enjoyable and make clear that they attempted make it enjoyable for the
audience no matter what changes were made etc etc the actors in those
seemed to want to be there and absorb the character role and make it
their own........ the two main leads in this did no such thing which
only did more to reek havoc on the storyline rewrite.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>They spoiled my childhood<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Visual graphics amazing, songs awesome, costumes adorable...BUT there
many but(s). 1. First of all Emma Watson is the worst choice for Belle.
Her acting is horrible, seriously who dares to call her an actress?
That&#x27;s nonsense! 2. Too many black people in France of 16 century. I
respect black people but such accents in every movie are annoying. All
this tolerance question affecting the historical quality of movie. 3.
What I hate MOST OF ALL IS THE GAY ACCENT IN THE END. This movie for
kids, not for seek bustards. I&#x27;m done. I hope the producers will suffer
in demonic fire for spoiling my childhood favorite cartoon.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I loved this film!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Very much like the cartoon! The singing was really good ... Emma Watson
... what a star! The acting was great. I was in two minds about seeing
this as it&#x27;s my favorite fairy story and my favorite Disney cartoon. I
was in tears at the end, even though I knew the story backwards. Why
didn&#x27;t I give it 10 ... The thing that let it down a little for me was
the make up of The Beast, I thought it was a little too scary for the
film and the wolves were quite a bit nastier than the cartoon version.
Young children may be scared by these things.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Very well-done live action remake to one of my favorite Disney animated classics<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Exceptionally well-done live action remake to one of my favorite Disney
animated classics. Great casting, well-acted, amazing CGI affects, and
memorable musical numbers. The story-line is pretty much similar with
the animated version, but with some nice background story additions
about Belle&#x27;s mother and the Beast/Prince&#x27;s father. Also liked the
linking of magical enchantress to the villager &#x22;outcast&#x22; commoner
Agathe. The 3 new songs &#x22;Days In The Sun&#x22;, &#x22;How Does A Moment Last
Forever&#x22;, and &#x22;Evermore&#x22; added nice depth and background to this
live-action version.The 2 acting performances which stood out were Emma Watson (Belle) and
Luke Evans (Gaston). They both brought their animated characters to
real-life as well as could be imagined. Emma Watson gave a charming,
intelligent, sincere, and radiant performance as Belle. She performed
her various singing moments admirably and with good emotion for a 1st
time singer in a movie. It would be hard to imagine another actress who
could have played this role of Belle as well as Emma Watson. She has
made a nice transition from her childhood acting role as Hermione
Granger in the Harry Potter movies to Belle in &#x22;Beauty &#x26; The Beast&#x22;.
Luke Evans gave an entertaining, profoundly over-the-top, and
eventually villainous performance as Gaston. His singing prowess and
theater background came through in his 2 musical numbers. Next to the
CGI driven &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; and &#x22;Evermore&#x22;, Gaston&#x27;s 2 musical numbers
were among the most memorable musical moments.The other supporting cast members, from Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian
McKellan as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, and Kevin Kline as
Maurice fit their roles very well and pitch perfect also. The only reasons I only gave the remake 9 stars out of 10 are the
Beast/Prince character and the ending felt a little rushed. As far as
the Beast/Prince, his performance felt a bit too understated and smug
at first compared to the animated version. His efforts to gain Belle&#x27;s
affection had more of a plan in the animated version than this live
action version. The one scene where this difference stands out is when
the Beast/Prince introduces Belle to his large library room. It is
different and not as planned compared to the animated version. Also,
would have preferred that the Beast had more human acting moments after
his transformation back to a Prince. Dan Stevens still gave a very good
performance as Beast/Prince, but just not up to the level of excellence
as the rest of the cast. This brings me to the ending, which felt a
little rushed. It would have been nice to extend the ending a little
bit longer to get to know the human version of the castle characters
after the curse was broken and their transformation back to human form
was completed. Minor criticisms, but very few movies can be
perfect...lol.Overall, great live-action remake by Disney. Well-cast, beautifully
performed, and expertly directed. After &#x22;Beauty &#x26; The Beast&#x22; and
&#x22;Jungle Book&#x22;, looking forward to more Disney live-action remakes. I
believe &#x22;The Lion King&#x22; is up next.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Rubbish<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I had very high hopes for this movie. Emma Watson&#x27;s performance leaves
much to be desired. Her facial expressions are atrocious and
far-fetched, not believable The original Belle is beautiful, genuine
even though she is a cartoon. The props are terribly executed and look
fake. The only good actor here is maybe Philippe the horse. It is hard
to compete with the original movie which is truly beautiful.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A very good remake of a classic story<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When the father of an odd girl gets kidnapped in a distant forest, she
sets out to find him, only to find an enchanted castle ruled by a
hideous beast. Exchanging places with her father, she slowly discovers
that there is more to the monster than it appears so an unexpected
relationship begins to build up. This movie retells the classic story
using live action sequences and state of the art CGI. It mostly follows
the footsteps of its predecessor, the animation film, and like it, it
creates an enjoyable atmosphere though its wonderful and captivating
story. The animated moments are top notch while the characters play
their role very well but I cannot escape the feeling that it misses
something. It is mostly the same as the animation masterpiece that
inspired it, but somehow doesn&#x27;t manage to stay on par with it, or to
create and inspire that feeling that no other movie can. It is a very
well executed film, but it somehow does not have a soul, fact which
alters the overall sensation. A very good movie overall but you&#x27;ll
still have to see the animation in order to understand what I mean.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Amazing Movie!! Better Than First!! Just A Little Confusing.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I loved this movie so much it was so worth the watch definitely better
than the first one i like that Disney does these kinds of movies now i
like how they bring them to life its so amazing and the cool thing was
that they had a lot of original scenes from the original movie which
was very cool and they had some new ones as well but i like this movie
so much the only reason i rate it a 9/10 is cause certain scenes were
confusing and i didn&#x27;t get them as much but this is still an amazing
movie and im definitely going to by it on blu-ray at some point and the
ending actually gave it a better rating cause of how sad and also heart
warming the ending was but it is definitely worth the watch and i
definitely recommend buying it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Classic never change<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
We may be amazed by all the magic Disney created with the classic love
story Beauty and the Beast. With all the technology involved the
recreation of all the characters were magical. Besides the amazing
effects, the lesson remains the same: self-love. Belle is a girl that doesn&#x27;t fit in, other villagers think she is weird
for being interested in books and for not being concerned with how she
looks or appearances. In contrast we have Gaston who is the ultimate
hunk of the village that comes home from war to seeking wife, everyone
in the village wants to marry him, but Belle doesn&#x27;t. This makes Gaston
think she is playing hard-to-get and wants her more. Belle&#x27;s father is
the misunderstood scientist that creates beautiful things to sell in
another town. When Belle is captured in the castle, we meet the Beast as a terrible
and selfish person who is kept under the spell. The main character may
be Belle with all her intelligence and good-sense that shows us that
being intellectual help us see the tragic world we are living with a
new approach. But the character we can all relate to the most is the Beast, the lack
of self-esteem is what we may see at every age. How the Beast develops
in the story is the self-realization of who he really is and what
matters the most: to love ourselves is more important than what others
think of us. The Beast is enchanted for his frivolity and what makes
him behave like an animal, but when Belle comes and shows him that
outer image of himself is not the most important thing, rather he
should show who he really is; that is when the change of his own image
comes from within. To know yourself, is to realize that what matters the most to you is
what counts, and not what others think matter. Whatever interests us is
what we are truly passionate about and not what other tell us. To find
ourselves is to learn about who we are and what we are capable of.

Fans of the story, like myself would have seen every version ever made,
so with eager enthusiasm, I waited with baited breath for this version
to come out, and going by the colourful posters, it looked to be very
exciting...unfortunately, it was a huge let down. Emma Watson would
have had to be the worst &#x27;Beauty&#x27; ever, she lacked the maturity, and as
for the Beast, hm, was amateurish. The best actors were those turned
into animated inanimate objects, very enjoyable; loved the peacock, she
was so pretty.When remaking a popular story, it&#x27;s a risk, and this one failed to hold
my interest.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Big Disappointment<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
My review is gonna be useless, just because there are lots of reviews,
and they say it all. The cast is completely wrong. That&#x27;s just to not
say anymore. As fallowing, the role-plays was really bad! Only
role-play who would be more or less on the point is Kevin Kline as
Maurice. Shame.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Love the story but Miss Emma Watson is a miscast<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I always loved this story whether in a book, movie, play or made for TV
movie. The scene stealer was Josh Cad as Lefou and I&#x27;ve never seen a
better Gaston (played by Luke Evans). These two were the best comedy
pair I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. I was surprised when I did not recognize
who was playing Beauty&#x27;s father for several scenes since I purposefully
did not want to know the cast until I watched the movie. Great actors
can do that and Kevin Kline never ceases to amaze me. I give only 4
stars because the title is &#x22;The Beauty and The Beast&#x22;. Miss Emma Watson
is pretty but I can think of dozens of others actresses that would
better fit the bill as the &#x22;Beauty&#x22;. I was hoping that when she got all
dressed up she would transform into the Beauty my eyes were somehow
missing but she only looked like an imposter. I love her but she was so
miscast here that I assumed she was chosen for her amazing vocals only
to be surprised, disappointed and even embarrassed for her. Embarrassed
because she should have turned it down. It&#x27;s obviously her popularity
that got her the part. If I had never seen her in the Harry Potter
films I would have even thought her to be a subpar actress. I don&#x27;t
think I&#x27;ll ever get over it. Such ego. As for Dan Stevens as the Beast
he was acceptable and I&#x27;m sure would have done better with a better
casting of the &#x22;Beauty&#x22;. Not very much chemistry there. If not for the
miscasted &#x22;Beauty&#x22; I would have given it 8 stars. If the Beast were
also better cast it could have been an easy 10 stars.

Following the success of the live action versions of Disney animated
classics like Cinderella and The Jungle Book, we have arrived to one of
the big fish in the vault: Beauty and the Beast. Of course, this story
has been told numerous times before, but none is more popular than the
1991 animated version. Disney once again delivers a live action remake
of their animated film with a stellar cast and Bill Condon who is a
strong director. The results provide a good looking film with good
intentions, but choosing to simply retell the story instead of
providing new perspective.Good: The direction and production design is gorgeous. The look of the
castle, the design of the furniture, the costumes, and the sets all
looked wonderful. Even the CGI wasn&#x27;t too bad with the objects in the
castle. The songs that were in the original animated film are re- done
here with varying success, but still fun. The cast were well suited in
their roles with Luke Evans killing it as Gaston. Emma Watson was solid
as Belle although nothing fantastic. Kevin Kline actually delivers a
good performance her despite his limited role in the film. Josh Gad
does help give LeFou more depth in his character with his conflicts
with Gaston. Speaking of which, the controversial addition of LeFou
being gay bears little consequence in the story. Nothing in the form of
kissing or sexual innuendo that was blown out of proportion. An
addition, but nothing too in your face so this fighting is over
nothing. Bad: This film takes the beats of the animated film and goes through
them exactly how they were presented with little change. They do add
some additional scenes along with some new songs that don&#x27;t hit their
mark as much as I wanted them to because there are some interesting
ideas passed around in them. The singing is good for the most part, but
Watson&#x27;s voice does smell of tinkering that shows every time she goes
for the high notes. I think she can sing, but she&#x27;s not capable of
holding notes for a long time which shows in her singing. It hurts her
musical scenes which lessens the impact. I didn&#x27;t like the look of the
Beast here as they wanted to give him a more human face which defeats
the purpose of him looking beastly.Overall, I wanted to really like this movie, but it played it too close
to home with its interpretation and relied on replaying the old hits.
The new content added didn&#x27;t do much for me either so both methods just
couldn&#x27;t work. I liked the revamped songs from the animated film and
there are some performances along with beautiful production design and
cinematography. Worth a watch if you are a Disney fanatic, but I would
say the animated version remains on top.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Lifeless and dull<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
So,. The wife has forced me to watch the new beauty and the beast,.
(Yes I love the REAL Disney version) Disney, you have destroyed another
classic with awful versions of the songs, terrible actors! even worse
casting! Gaston is huge, not a weedy pretty boy!! And belle looks 12!
The beast looks like a 17 year old dog! And what the hell is ewan
mcgreggor doing trying a French accent? This is the most unmagical,
heartless, lifeless, wooden bag of s**t that I have ever seen used to
destroy a complete classic! If you enjoyed this movie then You should
be ashamed of your self.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I agree with sticking to the cartoon<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I totally agree with several of the other user reviews on here that beg
you to stick to the cartoon. It is amazing that animated characters do
a thousand times better job of emoting than real live human characters
in the live action rendition of this film. I love Hermione but her
acting in this film is wooden. The Beast doesn&#x27;t fare much better
either. Gaston is pretty good at playing the bad guy, at least he
brings some passion to the role. But there is absolutely no chemistry
between the two leads. I really don&#x27;t see the point of making this
classic a live action except for the obvious one: for Disney to make
even more obscene amounts of money. Since they&#x27;re making so much money
off of all of these remakes and retakes and reruns and reboots why
can&#x27;t they lower the price of admission to Disneyland. We should be
allowed in there for free! Just sayin&#x27;.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The artistry was the only thing worth admission<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I must say....such a disappointment. From Emma Watson&#x27;s poor singing
performance (which is evident with the massive amount of
auto-correction used to make her sound decent)to the almost forced
liberalism, this was a disappointment. The ONLY redeeming factor, I
must say, is the beautiful artistry and imagination that made up some
of the CGI, etc. But even the CGI wasn&#x27;t perfect, as the hideous beast
looked handsome from the very start. LeFou, or however you spell his
name, was also a huge disappointment. (SPOILER--His progression from
star struck gay lover to &#x22;I&#x27;ve seen the light&#x22; type of character was so
rapid and forced that it didn&#x27;t seem anything other than fake and
propagandist--). Other factors, like not enough character
development/progression in certain areas, as well as some fluff areas
that were meant to wow you with cinematics, but otherwise contributed
little to the story, just lowered my overall impression of this movie.
A movie that has to resort to distracting you with pointless scenes
full of cool graphics means that there is just too little in the
overall story that even the director realized it. I also did not
understand the pastor role in this movie. He made a few appearances and
he seemed to be important...and yet he also had no real role or part in
the movie. Its almost like the director wanted a black guy in a morally
upright role and placed a pastor even though there was no story or much
interaction with that role. Such blatant propagandist inclusions are
just embarrassing.So between the moral propaganda, Emma Watson&#x27;s inability to sing, the
fluff scenes (as well as fluff in some of the music numbers) and LeFou
in general...it&#x27;s worth one watch just to compare it to the classic
Disney movie, but this is not worth any re-watch, unlike the classic
Disney movie.On a side-note, I think Gaston was played very well, and I would only
fault his rapid character progression (which I&#x27;d fault with the
director) and not the actor.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>This movie and the songs in it are exactly like in the animated movie.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
In this story the prince and his servants live under a spell after a
witch disguised as an old woman, enters their palace seeking shelter
during one winter night, but they humiliate her. The prince becomes
beast and that curse would only be broken when he finds a true love.
The beast thinks that no one will love him. So can he fall in love and
break the curse is the remaining film to reveal.The songs in this movie and the songs from the animated version are
alike. Emma Watson looked just perfect in the role of Belle, the
beauty. The beast was good as well, I mean the CGI creation. Disney&#x27;s
one of the finest. A beautiful film for the little kids, but I
recommend it to all watch.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Wooden Acting, Why British Accents?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The acting was terrible...it seems that every actor paused between the
next line, the timing was off, you were &#x22;aware&#x22; you were watching a
movie the whole time and at no point did it draw you in.Also... isn&#x27;t Beauty and the Beast a french tale? And the original
everyone had American Accents. So why on earth would they choose
British accents? It makes the whole thing feel cheap and contrived.This is one of a hundred &#x22;remakes just to make a remake&#x22; movies and
it&#x27;s unfortunate because if they really had cared about doing the
original justice and making a movie people could enjoy..not just &#x22;lets
take a sure thing and make millions off it&#x22; it might have been a
timeless classic. Also they could have introduced fresh faces, people
we could fall in love with not stone faced Emma Watson and Luke Evans.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The Rich &#x26; Ugly<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I read a fine comment on the story of The Beauty and the Beast - that
the moral boiled down leaves us with the conclusion that &#x22;if you are
rich you can be ugly but you can still get married to a beautiful
woman&#x22;. Well, if I would have a hang to be a conspiracy theorist I
would argue that the story was invented - or commissioned - by ugly,
old rich men to teach women that &#x22;the beauty lies within&#x22; ;)Anyway, after I have now filled some lines required back to the movie -
this version of The Beauty and the Beast feels like La La Land to me:
not really bad but far away from being an outstanding or a new classic.
If you like musicals you may watch it, if you don&#x27;t watch it you won&#x27;t
miss much. Music, setting, directing, acting, everything okayish. If I
would have to use one word for labeling the movie, that&#x27;s it: okayish.Conclusion: the best Disney movies are still animations. On the other
fields, be it Star Wars, Johnny Depp&#x27;s pirating or Mad Hatting, or this
movie, the outputs are mediocre, predictable - redundant. Frozen for
example easy beats imho everything Disney produced recently with real
actors and you have the advantage that you can give a real singer&#x27;s
voices to the animated characters, my wish: for the next couple of
years, no more actors singing, let them act and not bore me to hell -
if I wanna hear an amateur&#x27;s voice I take a shower ;) Next.

Beauty and the Beast is another utterly pointless cash-grab of a
remake. While not a bad movie, it is nowhere near as good as the
original. Somehow, this film is nowhere near as emotional despite the
fact that it involves real tangible human beings instead of cartoons.
The new cast is hit and miss. Josh Gad and Kevin Kline provide some
much needed charm and levity to the film. On the flip-side, the leads
(specifically Emma Watson) are spectacularly underwhelming. Emma Watson
simply does not look, sing, or act the part. The movie plays like a
pale imitation of the original. Ultimately the whole thing is brought
down by the script. It is essentially the same script as the original,
but there are certain changes thrown in simply for the purpose of
change. There are multiple sub-plots added which just come off as
unnecessary filler. What makes matters worse, is that the film cuts out
important story beats from the original in order to make room for the
new unnecessary sub-plots. Other than some solid visuals and
performances this movie doesn&#x27;t offer much. Overall, Beauty and the
Beast (2017) isn&#x27;t good, and it isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s just pointless.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great movie with one missed opportunity.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and found myself completely engaged at
times as if I was with the characters. I was sadly disappointed however
with Emma Watson&#x27;s singing. Perhaps I might not have noticed it as much
if I hadn&#x27;t been told before hand, but her singing really was not as
powerful or moving as it could have been with a stronger singer. Some
of the songs of this movie are my very favorite in all of Disney, and
it just didn&#x27;t deliver. Here&#x27;s to hoping that Disney will put out a
version dubbing her singing voice. George Clooney did it in &#x22;Oh
Brother, Where Art Thou?&#x22; and I don&#x27;t think any less of him, and it was
still a great movie.The following contains spoilers:I do want to say I absolutely loved the castle. I appreciated the
explanation about how the curse worked, as well as how Agatha was there
to take it away. The dinner scene was very fun. Luke Evans and Josh Gad
also did a very good job.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Mostly deserving of its popularity<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It&#x27;s weird how this has a high rating yet some of the most popular
reviews on this website are of the negative kind. I guess the Walker
brothers were on to something. I was quite impressed at how loyal it
was to the original Disney movie. I guess it&#x27;s hard to consider this a
live-action version of a cartoon when it&#x27;s simply a fairy tale that
most people are familiar with. If it is one, it&#x27;s easily one of the
best ever made. I was mostly impressed by how beautiful this film
looks. The CGI is really good in this. I especially love how they make
the objects just come alive.My favorite part in this movie is my favorite part from the original
movie. It&#x27;s where the house objects fight the angry mob. I&#x27;m just so
impressed at them actually winning. There is one thing that really
bothers me. This film was advertised as having the first openly gay
Disney character, even though LaFour only dances with a man for a few
seconds. This was done better in the last episode of &#x22;Gravity Falls&#x22;
much better with the sheriff and deputy. Still, this is a good movie
with great atmosphere with really good pacing, not easy for a longer
movie. Thanks for including the classic songs from the original. ***
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Enjoyable, but with a few pressing issues...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
With Beauty &#x26; the Beast being one of my all time favourite animated
Disney movies, I was so excited for a very long time for the live
action film to come out. When I went to the cinema to watch it I could
barely contain myself!The film itself is enjoyable. The plot stays very much to the original
with a few changes, such as a bit more back story for Belle and Beast,
and Maurice not being an inventor (why? I&#x27;m not really sure). The back
stories were intriguing, however I felt that they did not really add
much to the film or plot, and felt like they were almost thrown in
there as a last minute thing to fill in screen time. I feel I need to talk about the musical numbers in the film. A lot of
them were fabulous, Be Our Guest was hugely pleasing both aesthetically
and acoustically, and Gaston was brilliant - along with Josh Gad and
Luke Evans really being the highlight of the cast in general for me.
Belle (the song in the village) was done quite well, however Emma
Watson&#x27;s singing voice generally throughout the film is rather flat and
uninspiring compared to Paige O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s performance in the 1991
version... plus some of the autotuning particularly in this number was
so glaringly obvious it was almost laughable. Something There was a big
let down for me... it really lacked the fun and intrigue of the
original. Beauty &#x26; the Beast was lovely and I really enjoyed it, though
it probably will still never compare to Angela Lansbury for me! The musical score in general is fabulously put together and arranged.
There were a couple of new numbers put in, all of which I liked except
for the Beast&#x27;s song &#x27;Evermore&#x27; which I felt was just awfully written
and really did not capture the Beast&#x27;s doom and heartbreak at that
point in the film. The acting is generally okay... As I say, Luke Evans and Josh Gad were
really the highlights of the cast for me. Emma Watson is beautiful and
could have added so much more magic to the role of Belle - however, it
just felt to me that she was literally just reading the script, and
following the director to the point where she was not adding any of her
own flare to the part; it all feels very stiff and wooden. Dan Stevens
as the Beast was good enough, however unfortunately this is marred by
the design and appearance of the Beast, which is really truly quite
awful for a 2017 release with such a huge budget for special effects
and CGI - which as other reviewers have stated, is quite distracting -
same with the wolves... especially after such breath taking CGI and
visuals in The Jungle Book. The castle staff were all pleasant enough (except for Chip, I don&#x27;t
know who did the casting for him but that kid can&#x27;t act at all), and
contrary to some others&#x27; opinion, I though the CGI on them was quite
good. Kevin Kline did a great job as Maurice and I really enjoyed his
performance. Overall, a pleasant watch and I did enjoy the film. I just feel that it
could have had more done to inject some real magic, like the original,
into the mix.

This is a great stunning adaptation of the tale .. Fantastic Visual
effects , Costume Design , Songs &#x26; Music .. I believe Beauty &#x26; The
Beast will take part of the Oscar awards ceremony . Yet , The acting
was fine but not reaching the level of the expectations or the same
level of the other aspects of the movie ( music , visuals , etc .. )
The movie is really outstanding and breathtaking .. I enjoyed every
part of it , It&#x27;s like a painting that is amazingly painted .
Surprisingly , I liked it more than the old version .
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Quite a few things to like, but, all-in-all, not very good<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Most of all, it&#x27;s inferior to the original cartoon. Emma Watson is not
cute, old songs are not played and sung as well and the new ones are
not as good, the whole &#x22;live household&#x22; doesn&#x27;t work as good (one of
the biggest letdowns is the little teacup, Chip) and the fundamental
plot is revealed right at the start. I mean, sure, most folks did see
the cartoon and/or know the tale, yet, it works much better when you
discover it as you go along, because you have a better understanding of
what Belle is going through. .But, Gaston works surprisingly well, Lumiere too - kind of makes you
think Ewan McGregor can do no wrong in a musical. Kevin Klein as a
somber old man (Belle&#x27;s father) is interesting. The wolves sequences
are very well done. There are several good jokes, some of which are not
repeated from the cartoon, Bell has a few nice moments (though most are
repeated from the cartoon).So, it&#x27;s OK, but not very good and certainly way over-hyped.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappointing.....................<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Lets get to the point. Those who have watched 2014 Franco - German
Romantic Fantasy Film titled &#x22; La Belle et la Bete &#x22;(Beauty and the
Beast), You would find how awful this movie is! Everything is bad about
this movie. May be children could digest this with all the musical
chores.Emma Watson didn&#x27;t make any difference to this movie as well. In fact I strongly believe that this movie is a clear adaptation of the
above said French movie &#x22; La Belle et La Bete &#x22;. I truly suggest
everyone to watch the french version to know the difference.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>&#x27;Beauty and the Beast:&#x27; An Absent, Vague Reimagining of a Classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is a 2017 musical romantic fantasy remake of a
1991 animated film of the same name. It is directed by Bill Condon
(&#x22;Twilight: Breaking Dawn&#x22; parts 1 &#x26; 2) and is written by Stephen
Chbosky (&#x22;Perks of Being a Wallflower&#x22;) and Evan Spiliotopulos
(&#x22;Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&#x22;). The music is by Alan Menken (&#x22;Aladdin&#x22;);
the cinematography by Tobias A. Schliessler (&#x22;Dreamgirls&#x22;); the editing
by Virginia Katz; and the production by David Hoberman (&#x22;Monk&#x22;) and
Todd Lieberman (&#x22;The Fighter&#x22;). It stars Emma Watson (&#x22;Harry Potter&#x22;),
Dan Stevens (&#x22;Downton Abbey&#x22;), Luke Evans (&#x22;Clash of the Titans&#x22;),
Kevin Kline (&#x22;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&#x22;), Josh Gad (&#x22;Modern Family&#x22;), Stanley
Tucci (&#x22;The Lovely Bones&#x22;), Audra McDonald (&#x22;Private Practice&#x22;), Evan
McGregor (&#x22;Star Wars&#x22;), Gugu Mbatha-Raw (&#x22;Doctor Who&#x22;), Ian McKellen
(&#x22;X-Men&#x22;), and Emma Thompson (&#x22;Sense and Sensibility&#x22;). Filming began
May 18, 2015 in Surrey, England with an estimated budget of $160
million, and a box office totaling at $1.103 billion internationally.
It has a running time of 2 hours, 19 minutes (139 minutes), and a PG
rating for mild violence. Now to the review:Belle (Emma Watson) is a gorgeous, kind, and smart young woman living
in a small- minded village in France. Despite constant wooing from
village heartthrob Gaston (Luke Evans) Belle keeps her feisty
independence and devotion to intellect. Her father Maurice (Kevin
Kline) goes on a &#x22;trip&#x22; (Doing God knows what, that&#x27;s never really
explained), and she asks for a rose. Maurice ends up getting lost in
the woods, and comes upon a castle where, unbeknownst to him, a cursed
Beast (Dan Stevens) and his staff reside. Maurice is captured by the
enraged Beast, and Belle, learning of her father&#x27;s disappearance, goes
to the castle and trades her freedom for his. Slowly, Belle and Beast
fall in love, while a frazzled Maurice searches for help to rescue her.
He finally gains the trust and help of Gaston and his lackey LeFou
(Josh Gad). So here&#x27;s what I think it boils down to. Something as beloved and
treasured as &#x27;91&#x27;s B+B should not ever be made into a remake without
taking all possible precautions. You need a Belle who can sing and act,
a beast who looks fairly realistic, a CGI castle that actually looks
plausible, and you need an interesting and captivating script/plot.
Otherwise, the project should not be taken on.Obviously, this will be a huge box office hit. And I understand. No one
is immune to some nostalgia, especially from an amazing original
animated film. But I miss the times when cinema had standards. I miss
the clever and impactful films Disney used to make. If we are meeting
films like this with widespread approval, then what messages are we
sending for future Disney films?EDIT: I wanted to quickly type a little blurb on Watson&#x27;s Belle. Here
goes... As many of you may know, Emma Watson is a huge advocate of the
feminist movement. She is a UN Ambassador, and was fundamental in
releasing the HeforShe campaign. For this, I admire and respect her
(who wouldn&#x27;t). It&#x27;s truly inspirational to see young, influential
women like herself trying to make a difference. Bravo. Good for her. So
you can imagine, when Watson was announced as Belle, it was a huge deal
mainly because Watson is much beloved from her Potter days. In fact,
Watson revealed she had plans to renovate Belle and make her story a
more feminist inclined retelling. Here is Watson, when asked why her
Belle specifically, is a feminist:&#x22;So, we created a backstory for her, which was that she had invented a
kind of washing machine, so that, instead of doing laundry, she could
sit and use that time to read instead. So, yeah, we made Belle an
inventor.&#x22;Now, I guess one could say that that this is a slight improvement (no
matter how unnecessary) on Belle. But why? What more is being said?
&#x22;Hey, not only can she read, but she also can build things too! Now
that&#x27;s what I call a feminist princess!&#x22; But Belle was already a feminist princess. A bit outdated considering
our times, sure. But if you&#x27;re going around flaunting the term
&#x22;Feminist Belle,&#x22; then I expect more than one 1.5 minute scene where
she&#x27;s using her washing machine, and then a 30 second clip in which
that same machine is destroyed. God, what is your point? What more is
this bringing? What thought is this provoking? Now, I think the idea of revamping a feminist Belle is great. I do,
really. Watson had great intentions. But if this is all we&#x27;re getting,
then what&#x27;s the point if you&#x27;re adding so little?My Advice? Watch the original. 3/1030% F
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Redundant, but what the heck.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Upon viewing Jon Favreau&#x27;s Jungle Book (2015) for the second time, I
admired how far a departure it was from its Disney source material. The
pillars of familiarity were leaned upon but the films strengths were
drawn from some remarkable new ideas and execution. If Bill Condon&#x27;s
Beauty and the Beast (2017) can be admired for anything it is giving
the people what they want. Aside from a handful of new songs and
character tweaks, this new adaptation is almost painstakingly dutiful
to the 1991 Disney feature. There will be some, like me, who find it
all a little too redundant; but for the bulk of viewers the relentless
nostalgia won&#x27;t disappoint.There is no point in prefacing anything with &#x22;spoiler alerts&#x22;, as you
have already (ostensibly) seen this movie. Belle is the rural French
misfit in her small village. Beautiful, but &#x22;a funny girl&#x22; simply
because she thinks for herself. Emma Watson portrays Belle capably, but
without much range. Her opening number shows promise, hitting her
required pitches without unnecessary flourishes. She floats through the
lively town square in ennui. The long takes are well crafted and the
music plays like a sing-along, kids who know the words will make the
theater pretty adorable. Kevin Klein as Belle&#x27;s father (Maurice) is a
bit of a departure from the original. He is not the buffoonish cartoon,
but a more haunted widower. The Gaston role is filled with ease by Luke
Evans. He is a powerful singer and has the convincing swagger that
comes with the territory. His lacky, LeFou (Josh Gad) couldn&#x27;t be more
at home in the movie if he was actually animated. The issue with the
vibrancy of the setting is it does offset Belle&#x27;s dream of escaping the
&#x22;boring village.&#x22;Our first glimpse of the castle actually occurs in the prologue. The
arrogant and spoiled Prince hosts a glamorous ball that&#x27;s little more
than an embarrassment of decadence. A former plot hole is filled when
it&#x27;s explained that curse affects more than the castle. The local
villagers are cleared of any memory of the castle and its dwellers.
Years pass and Maurice has the misfortune of taking a fateful wrong
turn to the castle. From this point on the CGI absorbed setting just
doesn&#x27;t live up to the first act. Famous names voice the cursed
inhabitants, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellan, Stanley Tucci, and Emma
Thompson. Once Belle arrives on the scene the &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; number
can&#x27;t arrive fast enough. Once it does, I&#x27;ll confess to being a bit
disappointed. As the song played I couldn&#x27;t help but have the Orbach
track playing in unison to McGregor&#x27;s and it became all too clear I was
watching a remake, and only a passable one.I would say that the film is entirely unnecessary, were it not for the
amazing title number. I was not sure who had voiced Mrs. Potts through
the film. As the vocals began for the &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; dance, I
would have put money on Julie Andrews. I was pleased to find that it
was Emma Thompson, every bit the equal of Angela Lansbury. Much has been made about certain political elements in the film, (I.E.
Homo-erogeny, diversity.) These are trivial. Had the film developed
these elements into more daring areas, it may have provided some very
welcome spice to the proceedings. This is a beautiful movie, but comes
up short in ways I might be too apathetic to articulate. I craved
something that the film may never have intended to provide. If I had to
boil this review down to one adjective I&#x27;d say &#x22;harmless.&#x22; Not a
glowing recommendation, but you&#x27;re likely to get exactly what you want
out of it&#x85; just not an inch more.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I loved it!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I Loved this movie. Never saw the original, but my mom said it was well
done. I just know i enjoyed the new version! The music was fun. The
actors were funny and engaging. It was neat the way they used animated
objects and the voices of people. I&#x27;m not a super fan of musicals, but
it works for Disney movies.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Better than expected.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Okay I was not too thrilled over the movie by the time it was coming
out. First announced yes. I wasn&#x27;t so happy to see it anymore because
Emma Watson got the role of Belle. I like Emma but prefer unknown women
as the classic princesses. Even when I heard Angelina was Maleificent
but I LOVED her in the role after all. So with Emma, I didn&#x27;t love it
but she suited the part. Did rather well and I was pleased. After the beast transformed at the end I was smitten with Matthew from
Downton Abbey. Lol Oh how I miss thee. The show is no more. Another thing was the other characters. I did not like their new looks.
That also wasn&#x27;t so bad when watching. Although I much prefer Lumiere
and his women more like how they were. The bird is weird. Oh and Mrs
Potts, I miss the spout being her nose. Well I liked the cartoon ones
much more but I wasn&#x27;t as bothered by these ones as I had thought. Same
for the beast. In the posters and ads he looked extra ugly but when
watching it he was actually similar to the Disney beast. Lastly I thought this was going to be a whole new telling of the tale
but it was actually a retelling of the classic which I actually enjoyed
possibly more than a new creative spin. Including the classic songs.
That made me happy. Wasn&#x27;t a fan of the new songs added but oh well. So all in all. I liked it better than I had expected. Now I want to
watch the Disney one. Lol

What can you do when you have to remake one of the greatest animated
films ever made by Disney into a Live Action Motion Picture? The risks
are many. This films manages to recreate the great music and the
entertainment value of the original one, but fails to recreate its
essence or create a new one. In terms of Character development, it has
some troubles with the main characters. They are sympathetic, but the
depth behind them is flat. Emma Watson&#x27;s performance is pretty
disappointing, this is pretty obvious with the poor screenplay written
for her role. The supporting characters are other story, they are part
of what keeps this film going, besides the great music. Talking about
visual effects, the movie keeps the great work we saw in &#x22;The Jungle
Book&#x22;, maybe not as stunning, but still pretty good.In summary, this film despite of being entertaining, it fails to stand
on its own, paying the price of being loyal to the original. I have to
say, this is understandable, but stills a problem.I would say this is a good film, but feels small compared to the
masterpiece of the animated version
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just watch the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The original of this film is probably up there in my Top 10 of all
time, so I knew this remake would not be as good. All I wanted was for
this one to not desecrate my childhood memories of the original. By
that measure, this film was a success. It isn&#x27;t so bad that it ruins
the original.All actors play their role reasonably well, and for me the standout
being Luke Evans as Gaston and Emma Watson did a decent job as Belle.
Disney brought its usual flavour of production and most of the original
songs translated adequately to the live-action format. The opening
number, &#x27;Belle&#x27; worked the best in my opinion. However, some of the
songs really paled in comparison to their original counterparts. &#x27;Be
Our Guest&#x27; I thought was the weakest of the lot. Disney also
shoe-horned in a few new songs which for me didn&#x27;t really add anything.
Also, a few plot differences and new script twists seem to have been
manufactured just to make the film a little less of a carbon copy of
the original.Leaving the cinema though, I could only see this film as a pretty
vanilla, paint-by-numbers rerun, which in no way exceeded the original.
In that sense, I end up thinking, what was the point of this? Are
Disney simply just going to go through their back catalogue
re-releasing things as live action? It seems that might be the case. There&#x27;s certainly nothing new here, and nothing that makes the
animation look dated or comparatively weaker. As a stand-alone film, I
wish I could think of a better adjective than &#x27;OK&#x27;, but that is simply
how the film makes me feel. It will no doubt make the Disney
shareholders happy as it will rake money in, but for us that hold the
original in such high regard, this is a second-rate copy.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>No time for emotions<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It&#x27;s very sad to see, that the animated movie from the 90s has had more
sense of timing and creating atmosphere. The remake is alright, but it
misses the opportunity to create real emotions and strong relationships
between the characters. And to be honest, Emma Watson didn&#x27;t put many
emotions or any kind of good acting in this movie. There is a huge
party on the table, plates and bowls are dancing and making a fuzz and
all she does is stare and smile. I would flip the f*** out if my dinner
would dance and sing around me! The animation of the beast is
questionable as well and I think Disney could have put much more effort
in it. But at the same time Lumiere and all the other furniture were
animated really well and if they are in the scene, you&#x27;ll have a good
time! To wrap this up, it&#x27;s an enjoyable movie but misses the
opportunity to create emotions or any kind of atmosphere.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Stays true to the animated classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Keep in mind that it has been many years since I&#x27;ve seen the animated
classic, but I really thought this stayed pretty true to the cartoon.
There are some scenes that parents may not want their kids to see - the
wolf attack and the fight between Gaston and the Beast stay pretty true
to the animated movie, but seeing that in live action may be
traumatizing to little kids.I do have a bit of a beef with this movie, though its a complaint I
have with much of Hollywood. This movie takes place in France, and yet
the actors/characters are British. Hollywood seems to think there are
two nationalities - American and British. Lets broaden our
perspectives, people!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Eh?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
If you saw the animated version, then you have seen this movie. It&#x27;s
the same as the animated movie only live action. There was absolutely
no reason for this movie to be made besides as an easy cash cow for
Disney cashing in on the nostalgia of fans of the original. This movie
brings nothing extra to the table.It took no chances and pandered to
feminists and LGBT members when it wasn&#x27;t necessary. There was no need
to make a big deal of the blink and you miss it gay scene. There was
also no need to make Gaston&#x27;s sidekick gay or in love with Gaston. As
far as the ballroom scene, it wasn&#x27;t as mesmerizing as the original.
I&#x27;m not a fan of Beauty and the Beauty. It&#x27;s not my favorite Disney
movie, but I must admit the ballroom scene was a masterpiece by itself
and the best part of the original. I think the movie should have taken
a chance and used the concept of the moral of the story and use it in a
new twist like the numerous adaptions of the Cinderella movies do from
the cheesier ones to the better ones like Ever After or Ella
Enchanted.I checked it out. I loved the ending especially the clock&#x27;s
reaction, which caused me to actually laugh. I really wish they did not
CGI Dan Stevens&#x27; Beast. So it wasn&#x27;t a bad movie, but you can&#x27;t mess
with perfection. Love or hate it, the original was a masterpiece and
this one does not compare.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Leaves a lot to be desired<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSI don&#x27;t usually do reviews but this film was such a huge disappointment
I couldn&#x27;t fight it anymore. The original movie was so good and,
considering this is the exact same movie, there was really not much
that could go wrong. In theory of course, because in reality the final
result is just soulless. Everything feels fake. From Emma Watson&#x27;s
acting to the cgi and the props. I love Emma Watson but in this film
she is just playing herself trying to play Belle. To be fair though, no
one in the film actually manages to instill the characters with the
same emotion and personality as the original except maybe Josh Gad.
Luke Evans is very good but his character is written as a villain from
the start, while in the original he evolves from slightly annoying to
&#x22;evil&#x22;. Which brings me to my next point: the awful writing. The film
treats the audience like we&#x27;re stupid and needs to explain everything
verbally instead of just letting things show through the action. The
characters are one dimensional and don&#x27;t change as the story unfolds.
Gaston is the villain. The Beast is just a misunderstood soul from the
beginning despite the prologue telling us otherwise. Even his bad
temper is watered down. The writers had already the script written for
them, all they had to do was add a few more lines here and there and
create two or three scenes that would blend in seamlessly with the
original (since, I repeat, they chose to use almost word for word the
1991 script with minor changes). Well, the new dialogue feels very
wooden and unnatural. The new scenes add nothing to the story and, even
though the creators try to answer some questions we have from the
original, in the end they create new plot holes that go unanswered. I
miss the subtlety of the 1991 film in which every expression, every
line and every pause added something either to the progression of the
story or the characterization of the heroes without anything feeling
forced. I keep mentioning the original a lot but that is because this
movie has nothing new to offer really, so I can&#x27;t fully separate it
from the 1991 one. In the end, what annoys me the most is that the 2017
remake had great potential to become a new classic and stand on its own
had it been handled a little differently and not with a rushed &#x22;let&#x27;s
make some good money&#x22; mentality. There are very few good things about
this movie, one of which is the music which is simply magical and
manages to convey all the emotions the actors can&#x27;t. Then there is the
ending (after the transformation) where there is a more realistic touch
as the villagers remember their friends-relatives that work at the
castle and are finally reunited. Overall, despite the enormous hype,
the movie just makes the original stand out even more as a timeless
film that won&#x27;t be surpassed by another adaptation any time soon.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A meandering and dull mess. One of the biggest disappointments in recent years.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Sure, I&#x27;m a huge film snob who (on the surface) only likes artsy-fartsy
foreign films from before the 60&#x27;s, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped me from
loving Disney&#x27;s Beauty &#x26; The Beast; in fact, it&#x27;s probably my favorite
American animated film and is easily Disney&#x27;s finest work. It&#x27;s
beautiful, it&#x27;s breathtaking, it&#x27;s warm, it&#x27;s hilarious, it&#x27;s
captivating, and, in Disney fashion, it&#x27;s magical. When I learned that
Disney would be remaking their classic films, B&#x26;TB was undeniably the
best wrapped package. How could they go wrong?Oh man, they went wrong.First thing&#x27;s first: this film is so flat. The directing was dull and
uninteresting throughout the entire film and it honestly felt like one
of the Twilight sequels...and then I looked it up and found out that,
yes, director Bill Condon was the man behind Breaking Dawn parts 1 &#x26; 2.
Every shot looks bored and uninterested, which contrasts heavily with
the original animated film that was constantly popping with vibrancy.
The script too is boring because it&#x27;s almost a complete remake of the
original, though I guess most people won&#x27;t mind that.Next: the CGI is horrid. Although I didn&#x27;t care for The Jungle Book
from last year, I could at least admit that the CGI was breathtaking.
The same cant be said for this film. Characters like Lumi&#xE8;re,
Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, and most of the cursed appliances have very
strange, lifeless faces that are pretty off putting to be looking at
for such a long time. All of the sets too look artificial and fake,
especially the town towards the beginning. However, the biggest
offender is easily and infuriatingly the character that mattered most:
The Beast. The CGI on the Beast&#x27;s face is so distracting that it
completely takes you out of the film. His eyes are completely devoid of
soul, and his mouth is a gaping video game black hole of fiction. Klaus
Kinski looked much better in the Faerie Tale Theatre episode of Beauty
&#x26; The Beast, and that was a 1984 TV show episode. But do you know why
it looked better? Because it was an actual face with actual eyes, not
some video game computerized synthetic monstrosity. When will studios
learn that practical effects will always top CGI?Finally: wasted casting. Emma Watson is beautiful, but she&#x27;s no Belle.
She is completely devoid of the warmth and humanity that made the
animated Belle so beloved. Instead, she is cold and heartless
throughout most of the film. Kevin Kline is 100% wasted and does
nothing except look old. Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson,
and even Dan Stevens as the Beast are very expendable and could&#x27;ve been
played by anyone else. The only good characters are Gaston and LeFou,
mostly because they are fun and played by actors who breathe new life
into their original shapes. If anything, this film should&#x27;ve been about
Gaston and LeFou, but that would never happen because that would mean
Disney couldn&#x27;t cater to blind nostalgic 90&#x27;s kids.Overall, this film is a complete bore. It could&#x27;ve been better if even
the special effects were good, but the CGI in particular is horrendous.
I&#x27;m all for Disney remaking their nostalgia- catering 90&#x27;s films, but
they need to be interesting. This film, sadly, is not. Even the
Christmas sequel is better than this film because it&#x27;s at least
something.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Water and CGI does not an instant classic make<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it&#x27;s their
masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a new version was in
the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was
shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed
singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst
CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages. A film that is over 50% GCI, should focus on making that part
believable, unfortunately for this film, it&#x27;s far from that. It looks
like the original film was ripped apart frame by frame and the
beautiful hand-painted drawings have been replaced with digital
caricatures. Besides CGI that is bad, it&#x27;s mostly creepy. As the little
teacup boy will give me nightmares for several nights to come. Emma
Watson plays the same character as she always does, with very little
acting effort and very little conviction as Belle. Although I can see
why she was cast in the film based on merits, she is far from the right
choice for the role. Dan Stevens does alright under as some motion
captured dead-eyed Beast, but his performance feels flat as well. Luke
Evans makes for a great pompous Gaston, but a character that has little
depth doesn&#x27;t really make for a great viewing experience. Josh Gad is a
great comic relief just like the original movie&#x27;s LeFou. Other than
that, none of the cast stands out enough for me to remember them. Human
or CHI creature. I was just bored through out the whole experience. And
for a project costing $160 000 000, I can see why the PR department is
pushing it so hard because they really need to get some cash back on
this pile of wet stinky CGI-fur!All and all, I might be bias from really loving Disney&#x27;s first
adaptation. That for me marks the high-point of all their work,
perfectly combining the skills of their animators along with some CGI
in a majestic blend. This film however is more like the bucket you wash
off your paintbrush in, it has all the same colors, but muddled with
water and to thin to make a captivating story from. The film is quite
frankly not worth your time, you would be better off watching the
original one more time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Moral of the Story: Marry for Money<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast is about a deposed slave-owning aristocrat who
imprisons a farm girl. She undergoes Stockholm Syndrome, identifying
with her captor, then proceeds to betray her village&#x27;s uprising and
reinstates the slave-owning prince to power by offering her hand in
marriage.Furthermore, Belle&#x27;s contempt for the provincial farming community and
their lack of refinement stems from vague memories she has of a more
cultured upbringing in Paris. When she later is shown a vision of her
childhood house and remarks &#x22;it&#x27;s so small,&#x22; this was a moment where
she could put it all together. The lack of refinement in the rural areas was due to brutal
exploitation which forced unmarried women to beg in the streets. It is
likely that the community&#x27;s surplus resources were taken by aristocrats
like the Beast, and used to fund his opulent palace. Thus, depriving
the farming community of leisure time and resources for education and
arts, which would have made them more sophisticated, meeting Belle&#x27;s
approval.It is also possible that Gaston&#x27;s intense desire to marry, which caused
his nefarious plot, may be linked to lev&#xE9;e en masse, a policy that
required conscription for all unmarried French men between 18 and 25.
So his patriarchal demands were a direct result of state policy to
benefit the aristocracy by providing soldiers to sacrifice their lives
in land disputes between inbred blue blood cousins.Then, this exploitation provided a concentration of wealth and power in
the city, which created the market for her father to pursue creative
employment rather than farm work. This also forced them into slums,
where squalor and poor public health systems lead to the spread of
plague, which is met with cold indifference by the doctor, indicating
lack of public health care as a source of Belle&#x27;s childhood trauma. All of this exploitation and upward wealth transfer made its way back
to the remote plantation of the Beast.When confronted with this inescapable logic, what does she do? She
decides to take the easy way out and enjoy the life of luxury, waited
hand and foot by Beast&#x27;s slaves, who feed her, clothe her, sing and
dance for her. A life she always felt entitled to, on part of her
feeling of superiority towards her provincial neighbors.The moral of the story is, marry for money, and ignore the suffering of
the poor. A terrible message for children.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The corporate version of Beauty And The Beast: Disney at it&#x27;s most generic and dull<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear: where should I start folks. I had low
expectations already because I hated each and every single trailer so
far, but boy did Disney make a blunder here. I&#x27;m sure the film will
still make a billion dollars - hey: if Transformers 11 can do it, why
not Belle? - but this film kills every subtle beautiful little thing
that had made the original special, and it does so already in the very
early stages. It&#x27;s like the dinosaur stampede scene in Jackson&#x27;s King
Kong: only with even worse CGI (and, well, kitchen devices instead of
dinos).The worst sin, though, is that everything (and I mean really
EVERYTHING) looks fake. What&#x27;s the point of making a live-action
version of a beloved cartoon if you make every prop look like a prop? I
know it&#x27;s a fairy tale for kids, but even Belle&#x27;s village looks like it
had only recently been put there by a subpar production designer trying
to copy the images from the cartoon. There is not a hint of
authenticity here. Unlike in Jungle Book, where we got great looking
CGI, this really is the by-the-numbers version and corporate filmmaking
at its worst. Of course it&#x27;s not really a &#x22;bad&#x22; film; those 200 million
blockbusters rarely are (this isn&#x27;t &#x27;The Room&#x27; after all), but it&#x27;s so
infuriatingly generic and dull - and it didn&#x27;t have to be. In the hands
of a great director the potential for this film would have been huge.Oh and one more thing: bad CGI wolves (who actually look even worse
than the ones in Twilight) is one thing, and the kids probably won&#x27;t
care. But making one of the two lead characters - Beast - look equally
bad is simply unforgivably stupid. No wonder Emma Watson seems to phone
it in: she apparently had to act against an guy with a green-screen in
the place where his face should have been.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An Autotuned Mess<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This adaptation is a disgrace to the original. Watson&#x27;s voice is auto-
tuned to death and the Beast CGI wasn&#x27;t good. Each time the Beast
popped up, he was very off putting. Watson&#x27;s line deliveries are poor
and doesn&#x27;t do the animated princess justice. She also seems a bit too
young for the role. She is a total miscast. Despite the Beast&#x27;s CGI, at
least his performance was very good as both the Beast and Prince
compared to Watson. Emma Thompson&#x27;s rendition of Tale as Old as Time
does not beat the animated tea cup, but at least she was not auto tuned
to death. There are very few moments of originality as it is a frame by
frame copy to the animated film. It&#x27;s very uninspiring and unnecessary.0/10.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Plain<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Where do I start. This adaptation of Disney&#x27;s 1991 Beauty and the Beast
was an utter disappointment. Emma Watson as Belle was extremely
unconvincing from the start to the end. She had the same expressions as
the actress from Twilight. The animators did a terrible job with the
Beast. He looked fake and lifeless. They could have used special makeup
to create the beast similar to the Grinch where we get to see Jim
Carrey&#x27;s expressions. The side character animations were poorly
executed. Overall I felt the film was rushed as there was lack of
compassion and chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of CGI
and green screen which could have been replaced by normal acting,
because then why make an animated version of an animated film? This is
by far the worst remake of an animated classic.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Don&#x27;t bother stick with the original cartoon<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
My Childhood destroyed just re-watch the cartoon, don&#x27;t bother don&#x27;t
waste a dollar. Poor acting poor everything. I don&#x27;t even want to waste
another minute explaining why and how horrible. Just means i&#x27;ll need to
relive it !!!! A little tip to Disney, you don&#x27;t need to pick someone
whom is well known i.e. Emma Whatfor.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>As boring and emotionless as twilight<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Was lifeless, characters had no emotion or personality , found myself
rooting for gaston, he was the only cool one. Modern autotuned garbage.
CGI was awful and way overdone. Nothing like the original. Songs were
long and annoying. Dialogue felt rushed like they tried to cram all the
stuff from the original into it but ran out of time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>One of the worst Disney movies ever<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Bad movie for sure. Disney movies are most of the times one of the best
I have ever seen, but not always this is true which is the case here.
This movie was so boring so I was wandering what to do 1 hour and 50
minutes, only the last 10 minutes of the movie is worth seeing. Budget
160 millions dollars and the result is total disappointment. All this
musical elements in the movie is just too much, it takes away the real
feeling that this movie is supposed to bring to the viewers. Ema Watson
clearly is worst choice for this role, she was looking like Beast&#x27;s
daughter when standing next to him, she is just too young for this
role. This movie should be rated not to be viewed by viewers over 16
years of age. Overall very bad movie, it is a clear waste of time to
see this movie, but we will forget Disney and will wait for them to get
back on track this month of May.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Fantastic movie with high popularity<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This 2017 action version of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is definitely worth
watching base on my experience, because it remains a lot of classic
Disney feature, such as its classic music style, plot, foreshadows and
happy ending. I personally like its music the most, and I have the
entire soundtrack in my phone, even memorized most of the lyrics (No
joking). Moreover, there has been a change of attitude for myself to
the movie when I was first time watching it. I had a hard time trying
to convince myself keep watching it at the beginning, because I watched
the trailer and I thought that&#x27;s what the story about, but later on,
there were unexpected changes that brought me back into it, and I
actually learned a lot when I connect the story to the real life.After all, I STRONGLY recommend this movie for all ages, despite there
are some weird scenes that I&#x27;m thinking about that if we should really
show it for kids with no doubts, since the kids will possibly mimic
them at some point in their life and may be impolite to others. Thanks
for your patience!

1. Belle is basically the Hermione Granger of her time. Like there are
so many similarities. 1. They are both empowered females who always
have their nose stuck in a book thirsting for more knowledge, #2&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;They
both have muggle fathers&#x85;see, so many. And Emma Watson convinces you
that this character would look past the mundane, and surface level
stuff to what is underneath. 2. As an aside though, she seems to live in a town where everyone seems
to treat reading like it&#x27;s the devil&#x27;s water but it has a library
anyway, and that&#x27;s one of the things here which strikes me as more odd
now than the last time I saw this. I mean why does no one else like
reading, this version of France seems more like U.S. Congress. 3. The beast is again a cautionary tale here and that caution is- don&#x27;t
be an ******* or you won&#x27;t get any poon tang. OK, it&#x27;s a bit more
complicated than that. If you don&#x27;t know, he begins the film as a
prince who&#x27;s vain and detestable but is turned into a beast by an
elderly woman who he turns away one night in the cold. He has until the
last petal on a rose falls to learn how to love or he and his household
are basically trapped this way. So what we can discern from this is, be
kind to your elders, and yeah, basically don&#x27;t be a dick. 4. You can learn a bit more from the courtship here though than from
the 1991 film. The movie is trying to prove that there is something
beneath all the hair, fangs, and rough exterior and get to the tender
soul underneath. So I liked that the two talk and bond over books and
she reaches him and vice versa. The lesson is, locking down pretty
women is hard work. Yeah, he could have set his sights lower and saved
himself much earlier but who wants to be a prince with a desperate
chick hanging on your arm.5. It also helps if you can sing, and Dan Stevens can definitely do
that. He brings a gruffness to the beast&#x27;s voice without sounding like
Russell Crowe in Les Miserables, so that&#x27;s a good thing. Most of the
songs are in fact from the 1991 version with a few new ones. One called
Evermore is actually really good. Emma actually does a nice job here
too, sounding a lot like the Belle from the 1991 film. Only musical
choice I would have made differently is make Audra McDonald Mrs. Potts
cause she belted &#x22;Tale as Old as Time&#x22; a lot better than Emma Thompson.6. So let&#x27;s move on to the film&#x27;s villain, and i&#x27;m seeing a lot of
comments that Gaston is just misunderstood and all he needs is a good
woman to turn him from narcissistic, preening jackass into a kindly
soul like the beast. It&#x27;s a little bit like saying if Patrick Bateman
settled down he&#x27;d be less of an American Psycho. Gaston turns more and
more into a sociopath as the film goes on, and like millions of women
have shown us twice already, that just isn&#x27;t sexy unless your name is
Christian Grey and you own your own sex room. Luke Evans is perfect in
this role by the way. 7. It&#x27;s his little buddy whose been a bit more controversial though as
Disney made the announcement that Lefou is gay, which has upset certain
parents groups. Well let&#x27;s make this short and sweet. It&#x27;s as if no one
took a clue from a man singing about the physical attributes, sexiness,
and all around perfection of another man in the 1991 film and is now
like grandma finally coming to the realization that little Billy and
his buddy Henry aren&#x27;t playing video games all the time in his room.
Other than that there is a one second scene at the end of the film,
which amounts to just about nothing. This will not cross any kid&#x27;s
radar. 8. Looking at Josh Gad&#x27;s performance as Lefou though, he did what he
could. He&#x27;s a bit annoying when he doesn&#x27;t have good material and
unfortunately for the most part he doesn&#x27;t here. 9. But let&#x27;s talk about the CGI cause there is some confusion here. As
we all know the beast&#x27;s servants are all turned into what it would look
like if Pixar ever decided to make a movie about what happens late at
night in Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Candlesticks, teapots, clocks, they all
move fairly well here but they&#x27;re expressions came off a bit hollow to
me, which is funny because the beast&#x27;s came off a bit better at times.
Did the old lady actually punish the servants more by giving them the
facial movement of an overly-botoxed 60 year old? A question I kept
asking myself, especially after The Jungle Book last year, is what
happened here? This is where I really missed the animated movie most.10. That hand-held mirror that let&#x27;s you see everybody all the time
that the beast has is actually kinda creepy now when you think about
it. 11. Lastly, isn&#x27;t it odd that the film keeps telling us that Belle
wants to explore the world and wants so much more out of life but
neither movie really says &#x22;Belle went on to feed the hungry and help
the homeless&#x22; or &#x22;Belle traveled the world and became the first female
French chef&#x22; or something like that. It&#x27;s just &#x22;She lived happily ever
After&#x22;. Who the hell lives happily ever after though? And what does
that even mean? Maybe she&#x27;s just hooked on anti-depressants like a Long
Island housewife because her husband has stopped trying. Just saying,
she wanted to see the world but seems to be settling into a marriage.
Food for thought.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Shot-for-shot an inferior remake of the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I like to think I keep myself across reviews of films from all quarters
but I genuinely can&#x27;t remember reading one of Beauty and the Beast that
divulged it was simply a shot-for-shot remake of the original. So you
can understand my disappointment when I came out of the cinema
realising I could have saved my money and watched the 1991 classic at
home (for me, one of Disney&#x27;s greatest achievements).I have enjoyed the recent live-action remakes of Cinderella and
(especially) The Jungle Book. Each took the original story and added
their own identity with a few nice performances, special effects and
surprises thrown in. Beauty and the Beast however stuck firmly to its
original, successful model. And after the special effects master- class
that was the remake of The Jungle Book, this CGI Beast was horribly
fake and stilted in places.All the best songs were taken straight out of the 1991 edition. All the
best scenes were taken straight out of the 1991 edition. And despite,
on paper, the best cast yet, every single performance (barring perhaps
Luke Evans as Gaston) was eclipsed by the 1991 edition.I&#x27;m glad I spent good money to see the live-action remakes of
Cinderella and The Jungle Book. But with Beauty and Beast I feel I&#x27;ve
been conned by sloppy and lazy film-making purely for the purpose of
&#x27;cashing in&#x27; (which Disney have been highly efficient at again I might
add).Not a bad film... just entirely unnecessary. A waste of a great
opportunity and a great cast. I&#x27;ll be sticking to the 1991 original
religiously from now on.Oh, and for my money, some of the singing voices (Especially Emma
Watson) have been processed to within an inch of their lives.

This is a Disney movie for young girls. I&#x27;m in the wrong demographic
for this movie. Still I thought I might see it, because Disney movies
are meant to appeal to all.I thought the first part was fairly slow and I almost fell asleep half
way through. It picked up a little, but not enough.The movie is highly stylized and lacking in realism, which is not
surprising, I suppose. We&#x27;re in the world of ancient fairy tale, Disney
fantasy and CGI. But there were many places where I found myself having
to accept some contrived aspect that I didn&#x27;t really want to accept.But then every so often the director showed us some beautiful
animation, and the movie magic was there for a bit.The music and story didn&#x27;t inspire me or even interest me really.I thought the whole anthropomorphic furniture/household thing was over
done.I had a hard time with the &#x22;beast&#x22; character. I mean, yes, he was half
man half mountain goat (or whatever he was supposed to be) but he
wasn&#x27;t exactly a repulsive creature. He had muscles, strength, courage,
hair, good looks, intelligence, education and sensitivity. This movie
might have been more to the point if the beast had been truly hideous
and unattractive. So I didn&#x27;t really buy into the central moral dilemma
of the movie, ie that a man-goat is hideous and that a human girl would
never have feelings for a man-goat, or more importantly, that looks
don&#x27;t matter. Have I missed the point somehow?

Before entering the theater, I found myself scoffing at a review by
someone on IMDb, complaining it was a shot for shot of the animated
version. Saying, &#x22;duuuh&#x22;. Every line and scene from the trailer was
identical; da f*** did you expect?! But oh wooooow was she wrong! It
was a compilation of the animated movie and the Broadway adaptation!!
Bringing a new experience for some and the best of both worlds for
others!Worth the watch.

The movie was great. The score was a wonderful mixture of the original
tunes plus 3 new tunes as well, but no &#x22;Only Human&#x22; figure that one
out. The cast was brilliantly picked, though Belle came off a bit stiff
from time to time. The effects looked great, most of the time. Now my
main complaint. Gad. Why. Why do they continue to hire this guy? He
wasn&#x27;t very funny in The Comedians. I couldn&#x27;t stand his character in
Angry Birds. The butt jokes in Frozen, and then we saw his dairy rotund
and crack in Pixels with his antics in that movie (which would have
been better without that actor...) And then they use him like a bad
Kleenex in this film. Can we just stop hiring Josh Gad. He embarrasses
the parents that try to take kids to a decent movie... every time.
Beauty &#x26; the Beast was wonderful, but would have been so much better
without Josh Gad. He ruins every movie his mug shows up in. Secret
hidden Disney agenda or just continued hiring of a bad/disgusting actor
over and over?
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>This remake is not quite as beautiful as the original 1991 Disney animation movie. It was a paint by number cash grab<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When I first heard that Walt Disney Pictures was remaking the 1991
Disney animation movie of the same name with director, Bill Condon. I
was really looking forward to this. Maybe, this version could breathe
new life into the traditional classic fairy tale. Sadly, it does not.
Instead, the film, of course, not only simply replicating the original
movie content &#x97;i.e.: its script, and &#x96; with this &#x96; also its
corresponding themes, music, moral framework and &#x22;message&#x22;, but also
its nearly identical &#x22;frame-to-frame&#x22; camera shooting, despite not
being animation, features a different cast, have a few new songs and
some fixing of loose plot line from the first movie. Both movies tells
the same tiresome semi-disturbing story of a bibliophilic young woman,
Belle (Emma Watson) developing &#x22;Stockholm Syndrome&#x22; for her captor, the
terrifying beast (Voiced by Dan Stevens), because she sees some
humanity within him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, the
first movie is a generally highly critically respected as a work of
art, because how well-delivered and well-written, the songs, script and
animation was, this film doesn&#x27;t really stand out on its own, compare
to the other classic live-action versions of classical Disney animation
movies like 2016&#x27;s &#x27;The Jungle Book&#x27; &#x26; 2016&#x27;s &#x22;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&#x27;. Even
mediocre films like 2014&#x27;s &#x27;Maleficent&#x27; &#x26; 2015&#x27;s &#x27;Cinderella&#x27;, at
least, try to do something innovative with the material, they were
given. As much as I kinda like 1991&#x27;s version, I have to say, I kinda
don&#x27;t want the same story, retold to me, again without something fresh.
It&#x27;s sad, because I was really hoping that this movie would be more of
a hybrid of the first movie and the traditional story that was written
by author, Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. Who knows, maybe this
film could had reintroduce us, to the original idea of the fairy tale
that full of surrealist romper, metaphor and allegories imagery like
the 2014 remake of the Jean Costeau&#x27;s 1946&#x27;s version, while keeping
some of that Disney magic around. I wanted to see the version where
Belle&#x27;s father, Maurice (Kevin Kline) is a merchant, having adventures
at sea, only to find his treasures in ruins; meanwhile, Belle&#x27;s sisters
and brothers trying to tame the beast and steal his loots for their
own, but failing, because they don&#x27;t see the beautiful inside of the
creature. I wanted to see the Beast&#x27;s treasure turn into rags! It&#x27;s a
powerful message. Better yeah, I want to see the version by
Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve where Belle is not really a
merchant&#x27;s daughter but the offspring of a king and a good fairy; whom
a wicked fairy is trying to killed, in order to marry her father the
king; with the Beast, the only creature who can protect her. At least,
that version would make more sense with the backstory of the two lovers
past being brought up. In this movie, it&#x27;s pretty pointless, as the
tragic of their families don&#x27;t led to anything. Plus, the whole ex
Machina &#x27;magic book&#x27; twist would had more purpose in Villeneuve&#x27;s
version than this film where it was rarely picked up. Despite that, the
mediocre story isn&#x27;t the only problem, I have, against this film. The
movie pacing is a bit off. There is a lot of filler, that wasn&#x27;t really
needed, like the murder plot of Maurice, instead of going straight to
the asylum subplot. One of my biggest complains about this film, is how
this movie felt too much like an English accent driven West End stage
play with most of the cast, being over theatrical in their singing, and
dialogue reading than a realistic French movie. Don&#x27;t get me wrong,
Emma Watson and Dan Stevens are fine performers, when given, great
direction, but I felt that, the chemistry for these two, just didn&#x27;t
click, even if the Beast was lot nicer in this version and Belle wasn&#x27;t
such a stuck-up. Maybe, it&#x27;s because how fake looking, the CGI was. The
Beast, never really looked like, he was really there. So, I never
really got the idea of them, connecting. The same with the walking,
talking home furnishings played by great supporting performers like
Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson. I found them to be,
alright, but a bit disjointed. The same can be said about the
locations, like the village of Villeneuve and the Castle. It looks like
sets with limited structures, filled with a lots of blue screen that
was built in a staged studio than real-life locations in France. It was
really jarring. I wish, the movie took advance of filming outside,
more. Everything looks too control. Even the controversy idea of the
movie, introducing more minority and LGBT friendly characters with
LeFou (Josh Gad) &#x26; Gaston (Luke Evans) wasn&#x27;t really a big deal, as
there was nothing in this, that seem insulting. In the end, it was
alright movie to watch in theaters with your kids. Just note that the
movie will feel a bit pointless after watching it. After all, you could
had save money and just rewatch the first movie that was nominated for
Best Picture at home. At least, that is what I felt like.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Watered down, dull retelling of a timeless classic with questionable choices<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When you take a timeless classic like Beauty and the Beast, one of few
animated films in history to ever to be nominated for best picture, you
know there&#x27;s going to be trouble at the idea of remaking an otherwise
flawless film (that&#x27;s not to say the original was one hundred perfect,
but near darn close!). But this is corporate Disney at it&#x27;s best,
trying to take something that was so special and rehash it for more
money instead of creating something entirely new. It&#x27;s no question that animation is an extremely difficult medium to
translate into live action. From a creative (non-financial) standpoint
it&#x27;s controversial on whether or not certain films should be done in
the first place, as they can be difficult to recreate...and this
version of Beauty and the Beast is the perfect example of this. With
questionable CGI, wooden leads, a weak script and an absolutely
atrocious rendition of Howard Ashman/Alan Menken&#x27;s beloved 1991 score
you have to wonder where Disney went wrong. What were they thinking?Let&#x27;s start off with the good: the production values of the film are
breathtaking, make no mistake. The sets and costumes bring Belle&#x27;s
world to life as if the animation was real. Belle&#x27;s village is nearly
an identical replica of the cartoon and Beast Castle&#x27;s looks absolutely
stunning. Every last detail from the way Beast&#x27;s servants are animated
to the transformation sequences look fantastic. The cast for the most
part is competently cast and acted, with Luke Evans hamming it up as
Gaston and Josh Gad stealing the show with Lefou. Kevin Kline brings a
charming new rendition of Maurice as do Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen,
and Emma Thompson as Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Pots respectively.
The script changes Disney made to expand the lore of the curse as well
as provide more backstory on Belle and the Beast were a welcome change.
Two new songs added to the film, &#x22;Evermore,&#x22; and &#x22;How Does this Moment
Last Forever?&#x22; are pretty, but almost make the film seem overstuffed.
Some subtle moments that were changed also may rub some the wrong way,
however. The script itself didn&#x27;t add anything new and at times felt
awkward.Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, unfortunately, are horribly miscast as
Belle and Beast. While Dan Stevens&#x27; vocal tone and inflections make a
decent Beast, there is absolutely zero chemistry with his costar Emma
Watson. On paper Emma is a wonderful choice for Belle. Not only does
she look the part but she is a wonderful role model for kids. Sadly she
merely does not have the acting ability to pull off Belle convincingly.
Belle here lacked the innocence and charm of her animated counterpart.
This especially shows in the scenes Belle has with Lumiere and the rest
of the servants. And the unfortunate mistake of having Disney decide to
keep the musical numbers from the legendary songwriting duo Alan
Menken/Howard Ashman is where the magic is utterly destroyed. Not only
is it absolutely unacceptable on Disney&#x27;s part to cast two people who
do not come from musical backgrounds to lead a musical, (for the most
part Beauty and the Beast is considered a musical) but it is also an
insult to Menken/Ashman&#x27;s legacy. If Howard Ashman were alive today he
would be outraged. A huge part of the original&#x27;s charm is the music,
and the soul behind the characters. Instead of hearing the powerful,
heartfelt notes and chords that describe Belle&#x27;s longing for change, we
hear soft, heavily processed, robotic renditions of &#x22;Belle&#x22; and
&#x22;Something There.&#x22; It doesn&#x27;t help Steven&#x27;s singing voice sounds like
an old fart. If Disney really wanted Emma&#x27;s face so badly they could
have at least dubbed her voice. While Gad, Evans, McGregor, and
Thompson pick up the slack a little bit in their musical numbers, the
music still falls flat. To add insult to injury the instrumental score
was almost entirely rewritten by Menken for this film. What happened to
those quiet, powerful rhythms when Belle is exploring the castle in the
West Wing, or the dramatic musical tension where Gaston and Beast have
their final battle in the original? All of that is gone. Minor nitpicks include the CGI; certain parts of the castle seem
engineered which was distracting, especially the scene with the wolves.
Subtle script changes also removed a lot of the charming little
character moments that were present in the original. Lumiere,
Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts and Chip unfortunately suffered the worse from
this with barely any screen time. Lefou and Maurice were actually an
improvement over their animated counterparts, which was great. The
changes they made with the enchantress were also wonderful.Beauty and the Beast overall is a watered down, dull retelling of
timeless classic. Now that&#x27;s not to say this film is completely
terrible; children and families who have never seen the original will
eat up the gorgeous cinematography, charming characters and the lavish
musical numbers. But for those who are classic-goers like me looking
for an imaginative retelling, Disney&#x27;s newest 2017 remake of Beauty and
the Beast clearly shows that it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to it&#x27;s
predecessor. For those looking for a passionate, powerful, and
inspiring film, do yourself a huge favor and turn on the animated
version instead. On it&#x27;s own the film is below average, if not awful,
at best. 3/5 for an adaptation, 2/5 as a standalone.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Some Improvements Are Not Worth Making<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It&#x27;s been a tale as old as time, a song as old as rhyme Beauty and the
Beast. It was one of the animated instant classics to trigger the
Disney Renaissance of the 1990s, defined an entire generation of Disney
fans, set off some of the most iconic songs ever to grace the screen,
was honored in several lists by the American Film Institute, was
preserved in the National Film Registry the second year it was eligible
(which is a huge deal), and was the first animated film in history to
receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. &#x200B; So no pressure
or anything in remaking it, right?Many of us were worried that this remake would just be a line-for- line
remake of the original, but thankfully it&#x27;s not. Several updates to the
story are actually a strong improvement to fill in the problems with
the original. The whole village&#x27;s memory of the castle is erased by the
enchantress, a contrast made much more blaring by a cursed eternal
winter in the castle&#x27;s borders even while summer goes on in the
village.Belle&#x27;s father Maurice also has a more complex subplot that actively
engages both Gaston and LeFou, and he is motivated by his collection of
homemade paintings and inventions used to memorialize his family
legacy. This includes a backstory on Belle&#x27;s mother, even if it adds
virtually nothing to the plot.Other minor details are added to motivate Belle further, such as
teaching a younger village girl to read, only to be condemned by others
in the village. The parents will also enjoy this little detail: Gaston
is a former war hero, which gives his musical number a whole new
flavor. They also would find this new take on the Beast somewhat
compelling: he doesn&#x27;t even try to treat Belle decently as she first
comes into the castle. He just keeps her in the prison, only to be
moved into an appropriate bedroom without his consent or knowledge.There are plenty of other small plot holes from the original that are
explained here, as the characters make it blatantly clear. What I mean
is, it is done like this: one character asks a question we all asked
about the original, then another character simply answers the question.
Then the plot moves on as if nothing happened. So no high-class writing
to be found here.Although when taking the whole sum of the product into consideration,
the elements that remain the same compared to the original fall way,
way short. The director of this live action adaptation, Bill Condon,
who directed Dreamgirls and wrote the screenplay for Chicago, would
presumably know all about how to do a musical properly. Although his
skill is screaming to get out this time around, as nothing commands our
sorrow for his reimagining of the beloved characters. With the
exception of &#x22;Be Our Guest,&#x22; none of the musical numbers or recreated
scenes match the energy or creativity of its animated counterpart. I&#x27;m
not just referring to the fact that most to everyone&#x27;s singing voices
are hard on the ears, but mainly to the fact that everything is rushed,
especially the scene in the West Wing.If you think that you would feel charmed and nostalgic while watching
this, sorry&#x97;not happening. Maybe it works as a plot expansion of a
previously established story, but as a standalone you couldn&#x27;t help but
see the flaws. Belle even looks at the Beast more like she&#x27;s scowling
than like she&#x27;s captivated by him. Then with Gaston, he doesn&#x27;t feel
like a jerk at all, as in his first meeting with Belle, he doesn&#x27;t
chuck her book into the mud- but actually hands her flowers! Flowers!
From the guy we&#x27;re supposed to hate! It&#x27;s little details like this that
will halt any true joy or tears. But what else would you expect when a
remake is produced by a studio that cares more about social correctness
than casting actual French actors for a film set in France?Speaking of which, you may all be wondering at this point, &#x22;what about
the exclusively gay moment with LeFou? Should I worry about it harming
my kids?&#x22; Well, I can tell you this: You have absolutely nothing to
worry about. It&#x27;s a two second moment at the very end that is just as
subtle as it is super easy to toss onto the cutting room floor. In
fact, Josh Gad puts in just the right dose of humor and charm in his
interpretation of LeFou, and he actually can sing pretty darn well! So
you&#x27;ll end up loving his character by the end, whether or not you agree
with the homosexual lifestyle.Although if you ask me, this remake was never needed to be made. Yes,
it did satisfy many of the problems that people have complained about
for twenty-five years about the beloved animated classic, but it&#x27;s not
like this predictable fantasy is doing anything new or risky. If
anything, it&#x27;s just going to remind us of how much more moving and
charming the original is, and we can sleep easy at night now knowing
that some plot holes were filled without the animated film having to
explain it for us.Let&#x27;s just hope that the live action remake of Aladdin is not a total
waste of everything.

The highly anticipated release of the live action remake of Beauty and
the Beast had all the ingredients of a future classic. With the
animated film approaching it&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the hunger for
something like this is unfathomable. Yet, when the lights go on and the
credits roll, I was left feeling like I was swindled. The Bill Condon
film looks and sounds beautiful but the film is very thin in live
action form. Emma Watson is woefully underselling as Belle and Dan
Stevens does the best he can under the CGI-laden Beast. There are many
issues with the film at the heart of it but one thing sticks out like a
sore thumb: the complete and utter lack of originality.The film does nothing in the way of introducing anything new to the age
old story. The film is literally almost a shot for shot remake of the
animated film. While die hard Beauty and the Beast fans along with
their kids will probably enjoy the film, those looking for an extra
layer will leave sorely disappointed. Despite this, the film does offer
some explosive moments of action that are extremely well choreographed
along with Josh Gad&#x27;s wonderful performance as the comic relief that,
despite his performance being marred with controversy, ends up being
one of the stand-outs of the group. Then there are the musical numbers
and these renditions are just as magical as it was in the 1992 animated
film. They&#x27;re infectious little numbers that are bound to be hummed for
days after seeing the film. Despite these very positive attributes, the
film just misses the mark and never rises to be more than just another
remake.Overall, I was very disappointed by Beauty and The Beast. I thought
Bill Condon&#x27;s best work is left to be desired, the two leads are very
much so miscast, and the film offers nothing new in the way of a
remake. However, if these things don&#x27;t bother you, it is still a good
family movie that can entertain for a solid 2 hours but will do very
little outside of that. Is it worth going to see in the theater? No but
if you have kids, chances are you&#x27;re going to be dragged to it anyway
so just try and enjoy it for what it&#x27;s worth.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>People are not judging this film on its own merits...just viewing it with their reverence for the original.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
After seeing that this film came out on DVD recently and viewing it on
a whim, I decided to go on IMDb to get a sort of consensus on it.
And...wow! I didn&#x27;t think I would be in the extreme minority here,
because I loved this film. Loved it. Look, I get all the criticism. I
was skeptical at first too; I doubted Disney wanted to accomplish
anything more than a mindless popcorn flick with this film, knowing
hordes of mindless sheeple would flock to the movie in droves because
it&#x27;s a remake of a classic. Pure capitalism is what drives the film
industry now, right? But the longer I watched, the more my breath was
taken away. Yes, I&#x27;m aware that it is pretty damn similar to the
original; but the lush beauty of the film has a sheer opulence to rival
Versailles. Complaints on the character designs notwithstanding, the
absolute beauty of the village and the castle blew my mind. A lot of
people are complaining about the lack of originality in this movie. And
to that I say...well, it&#x27;s a remake. I&#x27;m aware that remakes can
drastically differ from the original, and I have no problems with
filmmakers being inspired by another&#x27;s work. But still...it&#x27;s a remake,
guys. It wasn&#x27;t the script from the cartoon repeated verbatim; there
were some nice, subtle funny new bits thrown in, and I, on one hand,
adored the new songs in the film. However, I will concur that the
subplot regarding Belle&#x27;s mom is historically inaccurate and adds
nothing to the plot. But regardless, I think the film did a good job of
triggering nostalgia while adding its own little flourishes in. Acting
and performance wise, I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people complaining about Emma
Watson; yes, you can tell she&#x27;s not a professional singer, but I think
she did a perfectly fine job as Belle. The real standouts here are
Gaston and LeFou as portrayed by Luke Evans and Josh Gad. They are
absolutely hilarious and breathe new life into these characters, and
deserve an accolade of some sort just for making them likable alone.
Singing wise, yes, you can tell that most of the actors aren&#x27;t
professional singers; none of them were horrid, though. If that sounds
like faint praise for a score of ten, it&#x27;s because I legitimately don&#x27;t
believe &#x22;Emma Watson has a weak voice&#x22; negates the emotions I felt
while watching. If you just let yourself enjoy the renewed vitality of
these characters and their story, you&#x27;ll see how genuine the romance
feels, how gingerly the characters develop into something there that
wasn&#x27;t there before. Bottom line: it&#x27;s a beautiful story, that&#x27;s why it
worked in 1991, and that&#x27;s why it worked yet again in 2017. If
anything, this movie rekindled my admiration of the original, and I
plan on viewing it again shortly.Pros: you know what you&#x27;re getting. Even if you do believe it&#x27;s a
soulless money grab, the elegance of the music and the tenderness of
the story cannot be eliminated. Also, the CGI is gorgeous.Cons: Again, it IS a remake, and if that bothers you, stay away. The
character designs of Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs. Potts, etc didn&#x27;t bother
me as much as others but definitely not as iconic as original. And yes,
Emma Watson is no Paige O&#x27;Hara when it comes to singing. That may be a
big deal for some people.In conclusion: Basically, this movie is the film equivalent of someone
rewriting your favorite book to be more eloquent, refined, and lavish.
Everything is bigger and bolder, but it&#x27;s still not the original.
You&#x27;ll probably still prefer the original, but you may return to the
remake every now and then for a renewed view of the story, that, who
knows, may make you appreciate it even more now.

I am a big fan of the original movie. It was a cartoon, so the
characters and their actions tended at times to be too silly and over
the top. However, this did not stop it from being one of my favorite
movies, containing some beautiful songs. The new Beauty and the Beast
does not disappoint me at all. I thought all of the actors performed
their songs very well, and I enjoyed the addition of some new melodies.
Belle is beautiful, smart and sassy; the Beast is frightening, yet
vulnerable and troubled; and Gaston is arrogant, vain and sexy. My only
complaint, if you could call it that, is that the local girls
enthralled by Gaston all looked like streetwalkers instead of village
girls. They could have been pretty and not so trashy looking. This
movie was enchanting, entertaining, funny, sad and thoughtful!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just not perfect and too cheesy in parts<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I wasn&#x27;t sure how this movie was going to go at first. I thought it was
a little cheesy in parts, which Disney usually tries to avoid. I
believe the Character of Gaston was overplayed by Luke Evans to the
point that I found him irritating (and not in the way he was supposed
to). He was just too Westend-like and he was clich&#xE9;d in his
characterisation. He turned into Michael Ball every five minutes and
over-enunciated his English. For a movie set in France, everyone was,
well, not French. We had Cockneys, an American, and absolutely no
French actors. I felt this took away the mystique. Having an English
actor playing a French candlestick was a bad move, the accent was off a
lot. Why producers think films like this can&#x27;t be a hit without well
known actors is beyond me. Emma Watson was natural and not cheesy. Ian
McKellern spoke, as always and never tries anything more challenging.
The songs were okay, but I&#x27;ve watched it five minutes ago and I can&#x27;t
remember a single one of them, but for the melody of the closing song.
For a movie, essentially about Bestiality it makes a good yarn. I did
enjoy it, but this could have been made extraordinary with a little
better attention to detail, which is Disney&#x27;s forte and casting. It
will do better in the USA, because it will pander to their stereotyping
- will we ever get a movie with an English person, who isn&#x27;t a Cockney?
or a non-existent posh stuffed shirt? I thought the CGI of the beast to
be clunky and not natural at times, particularly when walking, I think
that could have been so much better done. The facial features were also
a bit too unrealistic. The story is a good one, the script very good
and when Gaston wasn&#x27;t on screen, it immersed you in it. Then the
mystique disappeared as soon as he spoke, or even stood in his West End
clich&#xE9;d stance. He was a mistake in my view. Taking away that Stuffy,
cheesy West End style would have served the movie better and although
no one else really dropped to his standards, it was still a bit cheesy
in parts. If you are going to have a foreign actor in a movie please
God cast one from that country, or at least someone with a faultless
accent. Emma Watson carried this movie completely, along with Kevin
Kline and Emma Thompson, who is always brilliant. They had to get one
American in there and he was very good. All in all, I&#x27;d watch it again,
but will forever hate the badly miscast Gaston and I&#x27;d definitely
recommend it. Was it worth the hype? just!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Wow, such a bad follow up<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Wow, this movie completely enhance the rumor about how bad successor
movies can be. This movie completely destroys everything that is good
with beauty and the beast and consolidates the rumor of America as a
country without a soul for movies at a high pace. My 4 stars are for
Emma Watsons acting. It might be good if you have a serious
in-your-head romance for Emma Watson and like movies without a heart
and like to watch a &#x22;new movie&#x22; without any other acting or art skills
with a director that shouted &#x22;thats probably OK, we will go for that&#x22;.It&#x27;s almost unimaginable how they could destroy all other characters
than Emma Watson. And what happened with Gaston? Why? WHY??
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Seriously, do NOT watch this movie.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Whenever something animated does well some douche always thinks a live
action will perform equally well. This is just as bad as the attack on
titan live action movie. For anyone who watched the original movie you
will get disappointed.Scenes from the original movie that gave the audience different
feelings such as sadness or happiness are now replaced with cringe.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Absolutely stunning and magical!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Not sure why some adults with a thorn in their side have given this
film a below average score, it was absolutely magnificent! From the
moment it began you could feel the immaculate attention to the
incredible details visually. Any Downton Abbey fan will revel with joy
watching Dan Stevens as Beast. Emma Thompson as Belle was a perfect
fit, and yet brought even more depth to the character. I watched with a
smile on my face and a singing spirit to the favorite songs we know and
love. I can watch this with my three year old niece, my 13 year old
daughter, and my friends. In an age of trash TV and films that leave
you despondent, Beauty and the Beast 2017 paints you with gold leaf
tenderness and an abundance of giggles from Garson and La Foo.
Cogsworth and Lumier are brilliant, Ewen McGregor was perfect. The cast
was diverse, and open minded. The final scene visually blew my mind,
and had my tween daughter jaw dropped. This is a one of a kind,
beautiful film that all who made it should feel beyond proud to have
created it for many future generations to experience and clap to.
Bravo!

Before entering theater, I knew Emma Watson looked the part. Belle
means beauty, and she certainly is that. With a movie that&#x27;s highly
concerned with pageantry, her looks are especially important. More so
than simply supplying the necessary beauty to play Belle, she has the
right look. She conveys intelligence, genuine concern, and a longing
for more. It comes from her eyes. They tell her story. She expresses
her thoughts and feelings clearly in every moment without saying a
word.For the most part, I could take or leave the live action Disney
revivals. This one felt like it had more promise to me, and a large
part of that came from the apropos casting of Watson. As it turns out, she delivered. She does far more than look that part,
she acts and sings it too. For anyone wondering, it really is her
singing. Unfortunately, she and the other actors pre-recorded their
vocal performances, which were subsequently dubbed over the visual
scenes. That makes for the song and dance displays ring just a bit
false, compared to the sincerity of those in La La Land. Granted, I
understand that complaining that a movie doesn&#x27;t live up to the
standard of another movie that won six Oscars, is beyond finicky. If you were worried that the new voices wouldn&#x27;t do justice to the
originals, rest easy. Every singer delivers, especially Watson. What a
voice she has. Who knew Hermione had golden pipes? The film doesn&#x27;t wait long to unveil the real-life Belle&#x27;s talents. She
flexes her performing muscles as she glides her way through the quaint
village brought to life. Everything seems great, just a little long. And that&#x27;s the movie&#x27;s
glaring problem&#x97;it&#x27;s too long. The filmmakers took the original&#x27;s tight
1 hour 24-minute runtime and ballooned it to 2 hours and 9 minutes.
Even Emma Watson&#x27;s charm can only last for so long. I&#x27;m not saying the
movie needs to trim some fat, but there&#x27;s no way it would fit in
Belle&#x27;s dress. Thank you, thank you. I&#x27;ll be here all article. As much as I&#x27;ve raved about Watson&#x97;and I strongly believe she deserves
all the praise&#x97;the rest of the movie doesn&#x27;t quite make it. At times,
the spectacle wore off and I just felt bored. There were a few too many
songs, and a few too many verses in some. I don&#x27;t remember how long the
original songs were, but I know that I never felt bored listening to
them. For all the glamour and loveliness, something was conspicuously absent.
The movie lacks magic. None of the songs bombed, but they didn&#x27;t
exactly floor me either. Another issue arose from the added scenes. I understand the desire to
show us Belle&#x27;s mother and the Beast&#x27;s parents. Many children&#x27;s movies
omit parents, with the implication that they died, and that&#x27;s it. An
illumination of why the Beast (a prince at the time) so rudely turned
away the stranger worked fine. But was it really necessary? Personally,
I never had any trouble believing the spoiled prince angle. The
dastardly daddy reveal didn&#x27;t add much. Perhaps it was intended to give viewers more sympathy for the Beast.
Meh. He earned my sympathy when he showed his kindness to Belle. I
always thought that was the point. The enchantress cursed him for
treating people poorly. That was his issue, not his dad&#x27;s. The
insertion of the dad story makes it seem like the Beast&#x27;s reprehensible
behavior wasn&#x27;t his fault. I didn&#x27;t like that implication. I was disappointed to see a few missed opportunities with the minority
characters. A word of advice: don&#x27;t bother including a black person as
the bookkeeper if he doesn&#x27;t have a chance to do anything. He&#x27;s used as
a showpiece. Nothing more. That&#x27;s not progressive casting; it&#x27;s
condescending. Sadly, the movie&#x27;s usage of gay characters felt even more insulting.
Including a gay character is fine, even better than fine, if the
character is represented appropriately. In this case, appropriate
simply means not in an overtly theatrical and effeminate manner. The
whole stereotypical portrayal was annoying. I&#x27;ll end on a high note. Credit must be given to the unimpeachable Emma
Thompson, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Kline, Ian McKellen, and Ewan McGregor.
They performed admirably. Future live action Disney films, should learn from Beauty. Casting is
vital and so is keeping the runtime reasonable. Forever can spare a
minute, but I don&#x27;t have that much time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Over Rated<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Dear IMDb, 7.5 makes the movie to fall in the category of all time
best. Such a movie which one can watch unlimited number of times. Don&#x27;t
think you can watch then more then one. CGI and technology has given a
new life to movies, especially to Fairy Tales. But remaking one tale
over and over again makes the concept boring. Maleficent was the one
bad not only different but too damn good. This on the other hand, well
not that good honestly. Ema Watson has done a good job but the rest
were just pushing themselves too hard. Dan Stevens should have opted
for Gatson and Luke Evans should have played the beast. Lets say this
is an Era when a beautiful guy cant be the hero of the day it requires
more manly look. Josh Gad, such a stupid role his played. I know he
would curse for doing it for the rest of his life. In short awsomely
boring and with too much unnecessary music and the end is too cheesy.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Original still better but I was not disappointed<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Although it wasn&#x27;t as good as the original (because the originals are
almost always better than remakes) it was still an amazing movie.
Personally, I think the cast was wonderful and all fit their part very
well, even though at some points I could hear how they changed Emma&#x27;s
voice to make it sound better (which didn&#x27;t really work). I loved how
close it was to the animated version while still being original in its
own way. There are some things that could have been changed that I saw
people mention in other reviews but besides those I still thought it
was a great movie overall. Another thing I loved was the diversity of
the cast. I liked how they included more people of color than a lot of
other movies I&#x27;ve seen and how they also made LeFou and the guy at the
end gay because it really appealed more to me as a viewer and I&#x27;m sure
many other people, besides the people who disagree with same sex
couples who don&#x27;t want to watch a great movie just because of someone&#x27;s
implied sexuality. I&#x27;m glad that Disney stepped up and added more
diversity to one of their movies because it is something that needs to
be more widely accepted and happen more often in other movies and
hopefully Disney helped open up that door and others will follow in
their footsteps. TLDR; I loved the diversity although some things could have improved a
bit.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Lovely! I will certainly watch it again! Well done Disney! :)<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First of all - I love the original cartoon version. It was the
beautiful memory from my childhood and it will stay that way. As many
of other classic Disney cartoons. I am so happy, that Disney made the
live version of Beauty and The Beast, cause they did it right in my
opinion.They cut the bits that were...let&#x27;s say it politely, confusing and
leaving questions. Instead they&#x27;ve add nice scenes and dialogues that
are adding more depth to the characters.WARNING! SLIGHTLY SPOILING! :) I love that Le-Fou has more character than just a comic relief, that he
sees what Gaston has become and doesn&#x27;t agree with it. Also Gaston
character is much more interesting when he is explaining why he is
after Belle and not the girls that adore him. :)I am really impressed how Emma Watson is singing. That is a really nice
surprise.One little minus of the movie (which made me give it 9 and not 10) was
the one song where you can listen about Beast&#x27;s childhood. You could
clearly hear the auto-tune at the beginning, but otherwise it wasn&#x27;t
that bad. If I want to be picky, I would say that some of the songs
were sang in a strange pace compared to the cartooned versions. I still
love them thou.I absolutely love the effects in this movie. &#x22;Be our guest&#x22; scene looks
amazing in every way and the Beauty and the Beast dance took my breath
away. :)The ending makes so much more sense than the classic cartoon version,
where Belle says the magic words just in the nick of time. Here it is
more realistic and believable to me. :)Will I watch the movie again? Absolutely! I&#x27;ve enjoyed way to much to
just forget it. :)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>So very disappointing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie shines through it&#x27;s lack of credibility, humor and
especially passion. If you want to destroy a movie&#x27;s passion, put Emma
Watson in it! She&#x27;s like a petite female robot that acts like she is
still 10 years old. The others are no better! I guess it&#x27;s the
director&#x27;s fault here. Simply no vision at all about how this movie
should be!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Tale as Old as Time, Review too Old to be Timely<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was out of the country during Beauty and the Beast&#x27;s opening. At the
time I could care less, now I am a bit disappointed. There is no chance
this review will scale the mountain of 600 more timely critiques. I&#x27;m
not gonna get a single view. Back then I did not care, I was more
interested in the reaction than the film itself. I already assumed the
critical consensus would be mildly positive, the only question
remaining was if audiences would be tired of a remake. Well, B&#x26;theB
made budget on first weekend, so expect Disney live action remakes in
the future. Still, popular pundits were unhappy. Beauty and the Beast
was heralded as a pointless remake of a classic. Even as I wandered
Shibuya ward with the soundtrack playing in the streets, I resolved to
skip the film after returning stateside. Weeks later, I wake up to find
my younger siblings have made plans to see a movie and that I am
coming. So here I am, pleasantly surprised.You&#x27;re a crusty bunch denizens of the internet. I, like you, agree that
there is an increased burden of proof for remakes. However, many of you
must have gone to the theater convinced you were going to have a lousy
time. Beauty and the Beast is a tale as old as 1757 with films
adaptations released around the globe since 1946. Does this retelling
innovate and drive the narrative to new heights? Absolutely not, but I
will claim that this iteration is entertaining and does enough to
justify its existence.The story and most songs remain the same. It&#x27;s not a shot for shot
remake, but if you had any problems with the animated classic, I doubt
they went anywhere. Personally, I still think the first song &#x22;Belle&#x22;
makes the title character appear as a brat. Does this immaturity
validate Belle&#x27;s growth and some character arch? Honestly, it has been
two films and I am still not sure. Additionally, the Beast is not ugly.
This conforms to the axiom that protagonists can never be hideous. It
is an ongoing problem that has existed since the &#x27;46 version. No
serious sins here. If you enjoyed the animated edition and are
unallergic to a flagrant derivation there is nothing at the heart to
despise. The additional 40 minutes of runtime is spent on a couple
songs, a bit more Belle backstory, and most conspicuously some
dimensionality to antagonist Gaston and his henchman Lefou. These
clowns were pretty forgettable. Devoting additional time to expand
these characters seems like a solid investment. Gaston&#x27;s sick
egocentrism and the yielding but aware Lefou are a worthwhile comedic
duo. Unfortunately, the cornerstone of Beauty and the Beast is also the
best argument for why the film should not exist. Emma Watson cannot
sing. Her voice is excruciating enough to eject you from the world and
back into your seat. Thankfully Belle does not participate in every
song. Watson&#x27;s acting between numbers is practical, but this is still
awful casting. I don&#x27;t think any more thought went into this decision
beyond that a 160 million dollar picture needs a 16 million dollar
face. Particularly painful is how easily this problem could have been
fixed. The technology has existed for nearly 100 years. Dub her. Bigger
actresses with better voices have been dubbed throughout Hollywood
history and got over it. You think the sounds of rattling carts and the
clomping horses were made by what you see on the screen? Movies are
illusions.Rant aside, I did enjoy Beauty and the Beasty. Beyond Watson&#x27;s voice
(okay I&#x27;m done now), is a lavish world. Fantasy, medieval, French. The
budget did not wither away here. Every set is gorgeous and half the
songs have 100s of elaborately choreographed extras. And the character
design. Animation was once the only possible medium to realize Mrs.
Potts, Lumiere, Cogsworth and Co, but now modern CGI is more than up to
the challenge. Trailers do little justice. You certainly have never
witnessed anthropomorphic furniture/dishware like this before. I never
thought &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; would be matched in a remake. Too the purists I
just insulted, maybe the original still remains supreme, but the fact
they are comparable suggests this reimagining is worth your time. It&#x27;s
the same sense of bedazzlement. That feeling is worth more than
original story. Beauty and the Beast only marginally expands character
and narrative, but this potential shortcoming is compensated with
visual ambition.

I almost gave up on this movie because the first half is unimpressed.
But the second act does save it but not by much. I am curious to see
how it stacks up against the original so I&#x27;ll have to watch that sooner
rather than later. Anyway, the musical numbers are annoying. I&#x27;d say
about half of the songs are not even needed. But like I was saying
before, the second half of the film was saved by the very thing I
expected to su@k going into the movie, the beast. Whatever, I&#x27;m not
going to waste anymore time reviewing a movie I&#x27;m never going to watch
again. Six out of ten.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Missed Opportunity<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
***SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO DON&#x27;T KNOW THE STORY***CASTINGI liked Emma Watson as Belle, she&#x27;s a fine actress and a good source of
eye candy and was well cast in that role. &#xA0;Belle&#x27;s father, on the other
hand, played by Kevin Kline, was by far the weakest link in the cast.
&#xA0;He was a poor decision to play that part and I don&#x27;t think his
character was written very well either. &#xA0;The actor who portrayed Gaston
was absolutely wonderful, and although I don&#x27;t care for that character
in the animated version, I really enjoyed him in this movie. &#xA0;However,
as much as I like Josh Gad I don&#x27;t think he was a very good choice to
play LaFou. &#xA0;Along with not being so well written I thought LaFou was
kinda cringey in some scenes.PLOTI&#x27;m happy to say that the live action movie fixed most, if not all, of
the plot issues I hold against the animated feature. &#xA0;For example,
instead of having the beast begin hitting on Belle as soon as he takes
her prisoner it is now portrayed as a secret collaboration by the
servants to get their master together with Belle, one which the beast
initially resists. &#xA0;This works SOOO much better, imo. &#xA0;However, many of
the scenes are woefully underdeveloped. &#xA0;The wolf attack scene, for
example. &#xA0;The beast gets a couple of bites and we&#x27;re supposed to
believe he&#x27;s incapacitated for days? &#xA0;And the scene where Belle chooses
to take the place of her father was not done well. &#xA0;It&#x27;s a critical
plot point but they seem to rush through it. &#xA0;Most egregious of these
errors, though, is the handling of the climax. &#xA0;When the last rose
petal falls and Belle thinks the beast is dead, we as the audience are
caught up in the emotion of it all. &#xA0;She kneels down next to him and
then the camera cuts to show what&#x27;s going on in the rest of the castle.
&#xA0;By the time they get back to Belle and the fallen beast my emotional
investment in the scene had waned considerably. &#xA0;It&#x27;s a travesty and a
sign of poor direction or scriptwriting or both.CONCLUSIONI did enjoy the film, warts and all, and I like it better than the
animated version, however, I think it was a real missed opportunity.
&#xA0;It could have been magnificent in the hands of better filmmakers.

If you&#x27;re a fan of Emma Watson, go for it!I love Belle as a Princess. I
think she&#x27;s such a positive role model. She loves to read, she&#x27;s okay
with the fact that she&#x27;s different and wants more than her &#x22;provincial
life&#x22; and she knows that beauty isn&#x27;t everything. I&#x27;ve always loved the
original animated version of this movie and my daughter and I were
looking forward to this live action version with Emma but I have to say
I thought it was just okay.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s well done, but it&#x27;s Disney<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Not long ago while reviewing Moana, I wrote that, love them or hate
them, Disney studios will always be Disney. Professional to the very
last detail, but very shallow, and putting each and every story they
treat through their well oiled machine. I don&#x27;t agree with those saying the CGI are below par, or simply
creepy. I think they were expecting the old hand painted Disney magic,
and when seeing their old characters in CGI were shocked by the
outcome. I also think the acting was first class all the way through. I
didn&#x27;t even mind the songs too much. They always get in the way of the
story, they&#x27;re always way over the top, but I guess I got used to them. On the other hand I do have an issue with the story itself. It does
follow the old Disney version almost to the letter. That&#x27;s because
Disney studios believe that their version should be the only one. It&#x27;s
not such a big problem when the source material is well known and
available to all those interested, like the stories of the bible or the
Greek myths, I&#x27;m also willing to forgive these liberties with lesser
known myths, but when they do it to literary masterpieces I&#x27;m not so
understanding. I think the original Mary Poppins novel is so much
better than what they made it, it&#x27;s plain shame. I didn&#x27;t like what
they did with Peter Pan and Winnie the Pooh, but at least they did come
close to the intended spirit of the original. They failed badly here,
because they insisted on following their own footsteps. Have a look at
the 1946 French B&#x26;W version and you&#x27;ll understand what a story you&#x27;re
missing in this version.So they had the opportunity to remake it as a real masterpiece, they
chose to stick to their own old version instead. It&#x27;s just plain shame
even if it&#x27;s not a real surprise.

The first thing you should know before seeing this movie is it is not
the original film. throw all concept of the original film out of your
mind, because of you compare the two films, you will be monumentally
disappointed. Nostalgia plays a big part in why we love the movies from
our childhood, whether or not they are truly actually good. However,
the original animated Beauty and the Beast was a masterpiece of
animation. It was the first animated film to be nominated for Best
Picture. I know it is hard to try and drop comparison, but please, try
to do it, and think of this film as its own entity.This version of Beauty and the Beast clocks in at just over 2 hours,
nearly forty minutes longer than the original film. In the film, they
deeply explore some more of the themes of feminism and misunderstanding
that the original just glances over. Some of the exploration of the
past really works well. However, some sequences fall flat, like the
exploration of the Parisian windmill. Not everything necessarily needs
explaining within a film, and it almost felt as if the writers assumed
the audience was a little dumber than they actually are.One aspect of this film that drove me crazy was the visual effects.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there moments where I was very impressed by some of
the lavish effects. That being said, there were many times it was just
plain overkill. The Be Our Guest sequence featured far too many
flashing colors that made me think I was developing either ADHD or
epilepsy. I felt the computer graphic image rendering to be nothing
more than sloppy. the wolves in the movie made me wonder how any
computer artist could think that the work on them was remotely good
enough to put on the screen. That is how fake and unrealistic they
looked. I found big problems also with the design of the Beast. When
doing my research, I found that director Bill Condon wanted to create
the Beast with skilled makeup rather than CGI. However, Condon&#x27;s
request was overpowered by the studio heads in charge of the film, I
wold have much rather had a practical made Beast because his face was
at time frighteningly terrible. I gave praise to Logan&#x27;s visual effects
yesterday, and how well they were done. Beauty and the Beast brought
back to why I hate bad CGI more than nearly anything else in film, as
it can ruin so much within a singular movie. Finally, some of the
interactions between the furniture and the live actors felt clunky to
me as well. Many shots in the film had me question director of
photography Tobias Schliesser&#x27;s credentials as someone they did not
pick up off the street on the day production began. Many of the
pullback shots were so out of focus of the characters that you could
hardly see the character singing. Seeing as Beauty and the Beast is the
most expensive musical ever made, I truly believe they should have put
more time and effort into the visual effects.A major criticism of the film came in the casting of the actors, and
their inability to sing or fill the roles of the original voice actors.
Here&#x27;s the deal. Voice actors only have to worry about their voice.
That is the only thing they have to contribute to a film. Of course,
their voices are going to be better than live action actors, who have
many more dimensions to their performances. Yes, many of the actors in
Beauty and the Beast are not trained singers by any means sans Audra
McDonald. However, they give very solid performances of the songs.
Original songwriter Alan Menken even wrote some new songs for the live
action film. Are they slightly forgettable? Yes. However, they are
decently enjoyable tunes. The original songs have stood the test of
time of the past twenty-five years. They are bound to be more memorable
songs. Much of the casting was pretty spot on, in my opinion. Emma
Watson did a wonderful job exploring the feministic side of Belle,
showing the characters quiet strength in not only her acting but vocal
performance. There was no performance I think in the film that really
held it back. I still wish Jean Dujardin was cast as Lumiere over Ewan
McGregor, but you can&#x27;t always get what you want. Josh Gad is once
again a scene stealer as the more flamboyant model of LeFou. Also, if
you cannot handle a homosexual subplot for not even four minutes of a
film, you should not see movies. The &#x22;gay Lefou&#x22; storyline was blown so
far out of proportion by the media that you hardly even recognize it in
the film.Not enough praise is given to the technicians who create so much of the
films we see and get so little of the credit. The same goes for Beauty
and the Beast. The set design and costume design was lavish and
distinguished, and should definitely be recognized by The Academy for
Oscar nominations.Beauty and the Beast has moments where its brilliance shines through.
However, many parts of it feel clunky and too in your face. Overall, it
is an above average musical that is enjoyable throughout. If you must
compare it to the animated class which it is based, I give you this
shocking thought: Remakes are very rarely better than the original, and
this film is absolutely no different.Score: (7/10)

Disney did a wonderful job making this film absolutely beautiful. My
favorite piece of craftsmanship that was in this film was the costumes.
The simplicity of Belle&#x27;s costumes throughout were remarkably gorgeous
and the details on the villagers costumers were absolutely stunning in
their simplicity as well.. Another aspect that I thought was very well
done was Emma Watson&#x27;s acting. Being that most of the film&#x27;s characters
were CGI I think she did a wonderful job from her facial expressions to
her emotions working on a green screen. However, the reason I did not
give this film a higher review was because it was a little long for my
taste. The original film was only an hour and a half and this one had
added on an additional thirty minutes and I believe that these minutes
were not needed. At times, the movie did seem to drag on and I found
myself drifting off and thinking about other things, so the time was
something that definitely needed to be improved upon.

wasted my time to watch this boring Emma show. her still picture is far
better than this fashion show.i have seen 2014 version and it&#x27;s far
better than this one. I guess if there is no good story, make it a
music movie. LOL. well, some kids love it anyway. one positive point:
this movie is a sleeping pill.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An Enjoyable Film, But Disney Can Do Better<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
There are a plethora of one- and two-star reviews for this film on
IMDb. That signifies the film is worthless or nearly worthless,
providing no entertainment. This is a radical position to take,
especially when its accumulative rating is (currently) 7.8, indicating
that many people were entertained.That does not mean, however, that the film is perfect or that it could
not be better.The story is about the transformative power of love. Being a musical,
the viewer should expect romance and music. The music is an established
commodity. But how does the film realize the characters, the story, and
the action?I enjoyed Emma Watson as Belle. Her singing voice is more than
satisfactory and her acting fits the character. The other primary
character--the Beast--is more problematical. His CGI face takes the
viewer away from the action and disconnects the two romantic leads.
Also, the movement of the Beast sometimes looks weightless, as if the
he does not have a large and ponderous presence, which undercuts the
menace he is meant to project.I enjoyed the scenery and I think the camera work was very well done. Being a Disney fairy tale, we expect more than music and romance; we
expect enchantment. The overall effect of the film is enchanting: the
depiction of the town of Villaneuve, the renderings of the interiors,
the Beast&#x27;s castle, the landscapes, and the music, of course. There are
genuine moments that tug at the heartstrings, that jerk at the tears.The Beast&#x27;s facial CGI impacts the emotional content of his scenes
somewhat, but the film still delivers the Disney moments of heartbreak
and resolution.

My family and I were looking forward for this film since last year. It
didn&#x27;t disappoint us from the beginning until the end of the show. What
we would like to see was some never been seen before story plots.
Unfortunately this movie was exactly the remake of an animated classic.
Now we are looking forward for Beauty and The Beast 2 (if any).
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This live action version of Beauty and the Beast was amazing. As one of
my childhood favourite films I was worried when Disney announced they
were going to remake it, but I had nothing to be worried about. Emma
Watson portrayed Belle beautifully, and her singing was even better
than the original. This film brought a new lease of life to this
classic tale since watching it I can&#x27;t stop singing the songs!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Traditional Hollywood musical with modern techniques<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
If you haven&#x27;t seen this Beauty &#x26; The Beast adaption yet, please go and
watch this movie without prejudice. Don&#x27;t expect a &#x27;real life action&#x27;
version of the Disney animation movie from 1991. Better compare this to
a musical movie in the best Hollywood tradition, bedazzled with state
of the art computer graphics, it&#x27;s a treat.The Good: If you like musicals with luxurious sets, vivid colors,
you&#x27;ll love this movie. Also it&#x27;s a parade of well known actors, and
their voices. Some scenes are reminiscent of other musical movies like
The Sound of Music (Belle on top of the mountain) or Oliver Twist
(Gaston&#x27;s beer-drinking song) The woods and cloudy skies seem to derive
straight from Lord of The Rings. I felt myself getting into this 3 D
story book, enjoying every minute of it, although I&#x27;m quiet familiar
with the fairy tale.The Bad: IMO this Disney production is too much a remake of its own
animated movie, using the same colors and styles for the actors&#x27; wigs
and costumes. Then, naturally, people start complaining about actors
who are not &#x27;the real Belle&#x27; or &#x27;Gaston&#x27; or whomever they play. If the
makers would consider this a classic Broadway musical, they would allow
their actors to use the stage like in Phantom of the Opera or Moulin
Rouge. Now some scenes were copy paged from the nineties version, like
the living mops cleaning the castle or the flying dinnerware creating
all kind of abstract motions and patterns. They could have known those
creations are always better made in animation.Overall, I enjoyed this adaption very much: the story lines were solid
like the all star cast, some were better singers than others, with
notable roles from Luke Evans, Josh Gad and Kevin Kline. The scenery
and music score were perfectly arranged, the emotions right on spot.
Highly recommended for musical lovers!

So beloved was the animated version of &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; back in
1991 that this film was always going to attract perhaps more scrutiny
than the other films that Disney have taken from animated to live
action form.I thought a lot of this film worked very well. Everyone is well cast
and all the classic moments from the animated film are brought to life
with a lot of class and attention to detail.Yes, there are deviations from the original, with whole new songs and
subplots inserted, which people will either love or hate, but if
anything these enhance the experience rather than detract. I don&#x27;t know
what all the fuss was about Josh Gad&#x27;s character being gay, it&#x27;s been
blown out of proportion.This was an enjoyable new take on a classic film.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Flat Soda<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
OK so I&#x27;m that one person you know that hates that movie or TV show
that the whole world loves, the snobbish hipster that just shrugs off
the popular and goes for the one thing that people won&#x27;t look at twice.But you know what, even if I didn&#x27;t like the original Beauty and the
beast I still acknowledged it&#x27;s beauty and mastery. this one was just
flat and oddly directed...WORST PARTS = - The songs, just imagine a dove flying in the air... it now dropped
like a rock to the pavement and somehow changed into a filthy pigeon
along the way. that&#x27;s the songs in this film and sadly there are so
many of them that it&#x27;s almost a musical, also for the iconic ones from
the classic the comparisons just make them worst.- The shot framing, there is something very weird with how this was
directed. it&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t know where you are supposed to focus on,
everything blends with everything and the thing that was supposed to
stand out... doesn&#x27;t.... this really shows in the village song as Bella
blends rather then stand out.- CGI.... although the details on the furniture is lovely the whole
effect is more nightmare fuel (that wardrobe is creepy and yet they
love it so much that they keep zooming in on it!) - Bella. No offense to Emma Watson but she can&#x27;t sing and this is
almost a musical so she sounds flat and it brings her entire preformace
down, whenever she&#x27;s on screen I&#x27;m just bored.- The Songs/Musicals, it bears repeating how flat they were and there
are just A lot of them.BEST PARTS- Gaston and LeFou, They provided the humor and MUCH needed energy,
seriously everything else in this film is so flat and everyone sounds
so bored that those two are the only ones that look and sound like
they&#x27;re having fun.- The costume designs, those are actually really beautiful and vibrant.- The third act is actually good and high in energy, I guess they
wanted to wake you up before you leave the theater.I&#x27;ll just note that nostalgia is a factor which elevated this movie a
bit, I can see people liking it for that as it is a serviceable movie
for that...
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Good not brilliant considering the budget<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Emma Watson miscast hardly glamour for Beauty stiff unengaging her
voice not strong enough, the musical was made longer by unnecessary
songs. The Beast looked like a beast excellent makeup and prosthetics.
The CGI,effects were excellent as were the costumes and scenery. Luke
Evans and his sidekick Josh Gad struck just the right note.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A nice try that can&#x27;t get up the hill its fighting against -slight spoiler<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I wish I could love this movie more. I wish that I could think that it
is a nice new look at the story with some cool twists and ad ons, but
sadly it is not for me. Beauty and the Beast is a try hard movie that
just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype around it. The animated classic is a
best picture winner ad this film tries to be a shot by shot adaptation
of it, but it sadly simply doesn&#x27;t have the spunk of the original. The film does do some very good things. I did find a lot of strength in
the character of Belle and a lot of energy in Emma Watson&#x27;s
performance. It was a very good performance and one of the more
positive things about the film as a whole that I really liked about it.
I was really taken in by all the time and commitment she had put into
this role. The set design of this film is also quite good. I loved how pretty this
film looked and was one of the things that really grabbed me about this
movie and made it more enjoyable for me. Every design of the film mad
me more interested in learning about the world they inhabit and just
staying inside it. Sadly we have to leave all that beauty for a lot of slow meaningless
padding. This film just feels too long. With 2 hours in length the film
just goes on and on. The animated classic was only a hour and about 15
mins and told it&#x27;s story quickly and very welly. This film drags
everything out and makes it all too lengthy and I hated that about it. Also people made such a big deal about Le Fou being gay well then all
you gay haters can get over it and all you supporters can feel very
whatever about it, because they do nothing with it. They literally just
sit on it and have a few lines here or there, but for the most part if
that is what your worried about then don&#x27;t be. Overall Beauty and the Beast is a slow moving film that meanders a lot
and doesn&#x27;t know how to tell this story in a captivating way.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Hermione meets Gandalf (and Obi-Wan)<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
OK, so we all know the story. While watching &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;, I
kept picturing Emma Watson (as Belle) doing some magic trick that her
most famous character would&#x27;ve done; Ian McKellen (as Cogsworth) saying
something about the One Ring; and Ewan McGregor (as Lumiere) trying to
use the Force. Yeah, that&#x27;s the kind of person that I am.As to the controversy of LeFou turning out to be gay, what I ask is why
some people are OK with a story that&#x27;s basically a glamorization of
Stockholm syndrome but aren&#x27;t OK with a gay guy. Never mind that these
same people will read their children the Bible (which contains rape,
incest and murder). These people announced their plans to boycott the
movie, but I doubt that&#x27;ll harm Disney&#x27;s bottom line.And as for the director and the rest of the cast. Bill Condon
previously directed &#x22;Gods and Monsters&#x22; (about James Whale, the openly
gay director of 1931&#x27;s &#x22;Frankenstein&#x22;), &#x22;Kinsey&#x22; (about Alfred Kinsey,
the author of books about humans&#x27; sexual tendencies) and &#x22;Dreamgirls&#x22;
(a fictionalized account of the Supremes). The rest of the cast
includes Kevin Kline (my favorite actor), Josh Gad (Olaf in &#x22;Frozen&#x22;),
Stanley Tucci, Emma Thompson, Audra McDonald and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.So, better movies will probably come out this year.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful, but lacking of soul<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I love the 1991 original, so I was expecting a stunning live-action/CGI
reproduction and a magical 3D/IMAX experience. Basically, this film met
my expectations. It is beautiful, especially the library scenes and the
yellow dress. Lumiere the Candelabra and those CG wolves are also more
expressive than their animated version. However, as the core character Belle, Emma Watson really didn&#x27;t do a
good job. Actually, I quite like Hermione Granger in Harry Potter
films, but I am very surprised at how awful she acts in Beauty and the
beast. Her performance almost had no emotions and made this film
lacking of soul. It was far sub-standard for a professional.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Improvement on the Cartoon Version<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As much as I love the cartoon version of this movie from my childhood,
it is full of plot holes and unanswered questions. The new Beauty and
the Beast did a great job addressing the plot holes, giving all the
characters more depth, and expanding on secondary stories. I appreciate
the detail and thought that went into the scenery and animated
characters. They conveyed the desperation of the cursed castle staff by
having their faces look less like people and more like the objects they
were turned into. They are essentially dying and very close to losing
their remaining human characteristics. They clearly steered more toward
progressive moral themes. The cast was more culturally diverse, La Fou
and another villager are (albeit subtly) gay, and they better
emphasized Belle&#x27;s positive traits despite adversity and social
rejection. I think they chose Emma Watson to get away from the Disney
princess stereotype. Don&#x27;t listen to other reviewers. Go see it, and
don&#x27;t go in expecting to see the old cartoon version.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A very beautiful movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have not seen the original animated movie. This movie was a blast.I
had a great time wit it. Emma Watson was perfect for the character of
belle. Dan Stevens was great. Luke Evans was phenomenal as gaston. The
songs were great. The CGI was amazing. 3D was also good. Josh gad as
lafou did not have much to do but i think he did his small part nicely.
The direction by bill condon was great . This is a beautiful looking
movie and i had a total blast with it. I do recommend it to all .
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A good conversion of the original. Not better, but almost equally good<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I do not recommend to go to this movie if you did not see the original.
You have to be a little nostalgic to appreciate the movie. But,
supposing that everybody reading this review have already seen the
original, I would suggest to watch it. Emma Watson is the perfect match
for Bell. It gives the character exactly what it needs: confidence,
independence, complexity and cleverness. Regarding the gay content, I
do not understand why Disney included those unbigous scenes. It is a
movie for kids so why do that? The movie would not have lost any value
if the scenses were eliminated. Anyway, I have really enjoyed the
movie. It is very similar to the original, but a little bit worse.
However, if you are a little nostalgic as I was, you will really enjoy
it, especially as the original soundtracks were kept.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Has both its merits and failures over the cartoon version<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have watched both the cartoon version and real life version of this
film, and they both have their merits and failures over each other. The
real life version makes more sense in that they mention the prince did
read, thus explaining the library, but the real life version does lack
some of the charm of the cartoon version. This movie was reputed to
have a &#x22;gay&#x22; scene, but I couldn&#x27;t detect anything gay about the movie.
I feel that if you have very young children, go for the cartoon
version, but for older kids, the real life version is fine.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Surprisingly charming, despite noticeable flaws<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Growing up in the 90&#x27;s, my childhood was primarily all about Disney
films, those animated tales that helped us escape from reality, with
the original &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; still holding up today as one of
Disney&#x27;s finest efforts. So when a film that&#x27;s as important to our
childhood is remade into a live action adaptation, opinions are going
to be divisive, as they are here. To sum it up however, this film
(against my expectations) isn&#x27;t actually bad... but damn was it still
embarrassing to ask for a ticket for this at the cinema...Bill Condon is an unknown director, primarily for one reason, his
catalogue of films are practically tripe, yeah I&#x27;m looking at you
&#x27;Twilight&#x27;, so why Disney entrusted him with a project of this scale is
beyond me, probably revolving around financial gain, but heck this is
still his strongest effort to date.The best way to describe this film is that it&#x27;s technically a
shot-for-shot remake, but with extra filler scenes in-between. The main
&#x22;wow&#x22; factor of this film is in its gorgeous production design and
costume design, of which I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised got Oscar nominations
next year. The cinematography is generally rather alluring and the
visual effects are pristine, but lack in comparison to say &#x27;The Jungle
Book&#x27; (arguably Disney&#x27;s strongest live-action adaptation of recent
years). I can&#x27;t fault the acting (maybe Ewan McGregor&#x27;s flimsy French
accent aside) and the songs were executed brilliantly.My main issue however, was how &#x22;dumbed-down&#x22; this film was in
comparison to the original, perhaps kids of the 90&#x27;s were just a little
more intelligent and didn&#x27;t need those gags... who knows, but despite
it all, the film has that magical vista we all need in our life,
something to make us smile. Sure, it&#x27;ll never stand up to the original,
and there are noticeable flaws lying about, but this aside it is still
a charming film.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Adequate but unnecessary remake of Disney&#x27;s &#x27;91 Classic.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast is the most recent installment in Disney&#x27;s
ever-growing library of live-action remakes based on the company&#x27;s
famous animated movies of &#x27;yore&#x27;. Why is Disney doing this again? To
keep its non-Marvel, non-Star Wars, and non-Pixar stuff relevant with
the times. For the most part, Beauty works well in updating its classic
Best Picture-nominated precursor. But it&#x27;s mostly pointless and
practically shot-by-shot and beat-by-beat remake that introduces just
enough material to justify its existence. And the original is STILL a
modern film by today&#x27;s standards.There&#x27;s some truly pretty moments here and there, but because this film
is live-action, you can feel the painfully obvious reality that THIS
Beauty and the Beast film lacks the energy and expression of the 1991
original. Despite all the CGI-fueled imagery helping give some extra
life to some of the set-pieces, we&#x27;ve seen these pieces before in the
original. &#x27;Be Our Guest&#x27; is personally the piece I consider to stand
out the most in this interpretation. Ewan McGregor does have a unique
singing voice: I&#x27;ll give him that.This growing trend in Disney does seem to be working, I understand why
they&#x27;re pursuing remaking their own movies, but how far can you go once
you&#x27;ve run out of animated movies to remake? They can&#x27;t last and work
forever. I&#x27;m guessing that there&#x27;ll be a remake of The Little Mermaid
starring Sophie Turner as Ariel or something, and Melissa McCarthy as
Ursula; or Henry Cavill as Prince Eric? Michael B. Jordan as Sebastian?
*Groan* Disney, please keep focusing on Star Wars for the time being.
And don&#x27;t lose sight of the greatness Pixar affords your company in the
field of originality and creativity.Anyway, Beauty and the Beast: the first truly interesting successor to
the original 1991 film (the straight to DVD sequel vermin can FINALLY
be forgotten: for good)!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The animated version is better - and shorter<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The animated Beauty and the Beast is one of the few movies I own on
DVD*. I had high hopes for the live action version, but alas, it was
not meant to be.With a running time of 129 minutes, the new version is over 50% longer
than the animated version &#x96; and it feels like it. The movie seems
padded and I know I fell asleep at least once. (I kept imagining the
Disney exec&#x27;s telling the producers: &#x22;We&#x27;ve spent a fortune on sets,
costumes and set dressings, and damn it, we want to get our money&#x27;s
worth.&#x22;) Having said that, the production design IS gorgeous, but
oftentimes seems to take the place of story and plot.As to the cast, I&#x27;ve never understood Emma Watson&#x27;s appeal, Dan
Steven&#x27;s Beast is mostly CGI (as obviously are the castle&#x27;s
inhabitants) so that leaves Luke Evans as a very good bad Gaston, and
Josh Gas as his conflicted sidekick.The movie briefly comes to life with the three big productions number
of Belle, Gaston and especially Be Our Guest. The closing cast credits
are equally good, but it&#x27;s a long wait to get to them&#x85;Some of the CGI is surprisingly poor, such as the sequence towards the
end when the Beast is swinging along the castle&#x27;s rooftop. And, the
cinematography is downright vertiginous in a couple of shots where the
camera pans and tilts from the castle to the surrounding countryside.See it now if you have kids or love the story. Otherwise, wait for the
DVD, watch the three big musical numbers and the closing credits, and
call it good.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Still not convinced we need any of these remakes from Disney<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Credit where credit is due, I am glad Disney has chosen to go full on
musical (after the confusion that was &#x27;The Jungle Book&#x27;)if you are
going to have 7-8 songs in a film, Do it in a theatrical/ musical style
so I am glad they have at decided on that.Gaston and LeFou where hilarious, Gaston is perhaps my favourite Disney
character so I was prepared for the worst but I found him to be
(almost) the same character and Luke Evans can actually sing! (a rarity
in this film but more on that later) Josh Gad was humorous with a nice
arc towards the end that I didn&#x27;t feel was too cheesy.Ewan Mcgregor and Ian Mckellen had a good back and forth too, with
Mckellens final line a favourite for me (Turn me back into a clock!!)
The CGI (for the most part) is wonderful to look at and the costumes
are great as well. I was a huge fan of the animated version so I was
always going to like this film to a certain extent, however...EMMA WATSON CANNOT SING!!! Her voice was made up of 99% auto tune, it
wasn&#x27;t even hidden well. Emma Stone doesn&#x27;t have the best singing voice
but with the right songs and background music, it works in La La Land
(heck she even won an Oscar) &#x27;Belle&#x27; is such a powerful song and I am
afraid the film lost me in the first 10 minutes as I simply wasn&#x27;t
convinced, Waston did not even look as though she was singing, her
mouth shape was not right for the volume that it was meant to be
singing. As she sings in most songs, this was a big complaint.Did anyone else feel the entire film was ticking off plot holes from
the animated film? The decadent party showing us the Princes
selfishness? The village bewitched explaining the ignorance of the
villagers? Gaston behaviour explained by being a war hero? Maybe these
are details from the original fable, but to me it felt the director
watched &#x27;Everything wrong with...&#x27; Youtube video and was correcting
everything from the animated version. And what was the deal with Belles
mother? that whole section could have been cut and not made one jot of
difference to the final story. Another example of filler to flesh out
this movie to fulfil a 2 hour running time.My final complaint was the darkness, this was a very very dark looking
film, I saw it in 2D and I felt I was wearing shades. I couldn&#x27;t make
out parts of the film when the camera panned.All in all a bloated version of the original with some major nitpicks,
certainty not the modern masterpiece everyone is raving about but if
Zootopia can make over a billion, this will make 2 bil. Do yourself a
favour and watch the 1991 version, or watch this version when the hype
has died down so you don&#x27;t get lynched at work when you agree with me
(I am writing this reviewing from a cupboard hiding from a work mob!)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Brilliant!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I don&#x27;t understand how there are so many bad user reviews? Ignorant
people. I thought this movie was entertaining and adds to the list of
Disney classics! Emma Watson is a great lead and it&#x27;s really funny at
times! I felt pure emotion for the beast and furniture and was so
relieved when they finally transformed back. Don&#x27;t listen to these user reviews, go watch this and you will have a
great time!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Better than Expected<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Growing up watching Disney movies and being a huge fan of the original
cartoon of Beauty and the Beast, I went into the new live- action
remake with an open mind. And I was pleasantly surprised with the movie
and ended up thoroughly enjoying it. The movie does a wonderful job at filling in holes of the plot missing
in the original. It turns the story into something of more meaning,
rather than two people who fall in love. Belle&#x27;s sense of independence
and wonder and the emotional struggle the Beast faces are more
relate-able in the remake with live actors. Emma Watson&#x27;s performance as Belle is great, even with the somewhat
auto-tuned singing. Her interpretation of Belle showcases the
independence and charisma that the original character has. Dan Stevens
performance is equally as good. In my opinion, the best part of this movie is the directors
interpretation and writers addition of many scenes that fill in plot
holes. There is more background knowledge given than the original story
line, making it different and more realistic. Overall, worth your time to see.

Despite the great amount of work that went into this remake, I am
having a hard time seeing as anything but a cash grab. The story really
lent itself better as a cartoon. It&#x27;s a story wants to be friendly and
light-hearted with talking furniture characters that seem more like
people than actual furniture. It seemed like attempts were made to give
it the same endearing qualities as the cartoon like the Be Our Guest
number and the playful furniture characters, but these did not blend
well with the dark color scheme, making the castle in complete
disrepair and in a perpetual winter, and other attempts at heightened
drama.There are a number of reasons for re-making a movie, but I really don&#x27;t
think this one was warranted. The primary issue with re-making this
particular Disney classic is that the original movie was pretty good. I
do not get the sense that any Disney fans wanted to see a live-action
reboot, and the cartoon only came out about 25 years ago and does not
feel like an old movie yet. Also, there was nothing terribly new that
was brought to the story. There were a couple new elements, namely a
subplot involving Belle finding out how her mother died and the notion
that the majority of the village is gullible and unintelligent, but
none of these things contributed in any way to the larger story. On the
whole it was the same movie done in CGI and green screen sets instead
of cartoon.In a theme and plot sense it was quite clunky. The cutting between the
different plot lines and characters did not feel well-timed to me, and
perhaps if I cared to look back at the exact sequence of the movie I
would know why. The main thematic point of the movie seemed to be
missed a bit. What makes Beauty and the Beast a &#x22;tale as old as time&#x22;
is that it&#x27;s the story of one person bringing out the kindness in
another and proving that anyone can rise above their external ugliness
with inner goodness. The scenes in which Belle and the Beast grow
closer to each other were, in my opinion, the best in the movie; but I
feel like there should have been one or two more of them so that their
relationship was stronger by the time they had to part ways. Having a
bunch of the villagers be connected to the servants of the castle was
just another forced and unnecessary element to cap it off.I was not at all impressed with the distribution of acting talent. None
of the actors did a bad job, but lower-caliber actors could have
delivered equally good performances. In that light, hiring such a
star-studded cast seems like it was just a way to get more money.
However, I must say that Luke Evans and Josh Gad made a good Gaston and
LeFou duo. This was diminished to a degree by nearly everything that
LeFou did or said point not so subtly to his being gay. Having a Disney
movie feature a gay character is fine at face value, but I don&#x27;t think
they pulled it off well here.Overall, I cannot recommend seeing this. There is nothing here that is
better than the original cartoon, even in a visual sense. I went to see
it because I was curious to see how Disney would reinterpret a classic
story, but there was not much to see. If this is how the upcoming line
of Disney re-makes are going to be, I will not bother seeing them
because the people in charge of the story do not seem to care about
making a quality movie. Overall Rating: 6.2/10
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Mixed Feelings<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Before I start this review, I have to preface it by saying that I am a
huge fan of the Disney version that was released in the 90&#x27;s, so that
may have had a bearing on what I thought of this one.I have nothing against Emma Watson, and though I&#x27;ve never seen her in
anything else so I can&#x27;t testify to her acting ability, I thought she
was totally wrong for the part of Belle. She seemed to have only two
facial expressions: &#x22;Something stinks,&#x22; and &#x22;Something stinks, but I&#x27;m
going to smile through it anyway.&#x22; Some of the most emotional scenes
lacked the power to move me because I couldn&#x27;t get past how bland she
was.Something that really bugged me was the quality of the CGI. It wasn&#x27;t
just the enchanted castle staff, either, although seeing them brought
to life from their cartoon form was a bit jarring and creepy at times.
I was sorely disappointed in the appearance of the Beast. It seemed to
me that they tried to make him look too much like the cartoon version,
and it didn&#x27;t translate well into a real-life CGI look. All I could
think about every time he was in a scene was how off he looked, so much
so that it was distracting.There were some things I really enjoyed, like the fact that they kept
the original songs and even added some new ones. The &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;
sequence was particularly gorgeous, and I thought they did a fabulous
job bringing that scene to life.I like that they explained some things that weren&#x27;t explained in the
earlier cartoon version (like what happened to Belle&#x27;s mother, why they
left Paris, why the Prince was so awful in his prior human life, and
why no one seemed to remember the castle and its inhabitants). Luke
Evans was brilliant as Gaston, and they couldn&#x27;t have picked a better
LeFou than Josh Gad. The rest of the all-star cast (including Stanley
Tucci, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson, just to name a
few) were outstanding in their roles as usual, but I do feel like Kevin
Kline was underused just a bit as Maurice.In all, it was a decent movie. Because my expectations were high, I was
a bit disappointed, and I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s one I feel like I need to
see again or add to my collection. But if you&#x27;re looking to be
entertained and dip a toe into nostalgic feelings, you&#x27;d probably enjoy
it.

I really wanted to like this one. Although I did read many negative
reviews. But I figured I would go there with close to no expectations
and have a nice time because all movies are OK in cinema. And this one
has good actors and good story and big budget - how bad can it be? Well
I actually struggled not to leave in middle of the film. I do have one fault: I have seen the old movie a few times and although
I tried not to, my mind kept replaying the old one in parallel with
this new one.But this is because it completely fails to capture your
attention. It is devoid of any feeling. When a movie is this bad is
usually the director so I mostly blame him but all the other aspects
are also bad. The actors have no chemistry (there is no feeling of a
relation between beauty and the beast), the objects are indeed creepy
from time to time, the scenario has been slightly altered but in all
the wrong ways and the movie&#x27;s CGI is also embarrassing at times. The
scenery is also far to shiny, I couldn&#x27;t stay focused on the
characters, you constantly have this feeling that the screen is to
small and the 3D is also silly at times (rocks and arrows rushing into
your eyes, I thought we left that behind). I stayed hoping that I will appreciate some parts of it but I actually
hated it from the first words (the narration has no magic, it just
sound like a bored woman) to the last lines between Belle and the
Prince. The only good thing is that it makes you appreciate the old one.
Sometimes we take things for granted and believe that it&#x27;s easy to make
a good movie. I mean good story, good actors what can go wrong, right?
I used to see the old movie like a typical beautiful Disney cartoon but
I have a lot more consideration for it now.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Slightly Nostalgic &#x26; Incredibly Flat.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Firstly, can I suggest that perhaps it would have been better had they
strayed away from a classic remake, but instead, had created a comedic
prequel featuring Gaston and LeFou since they were the real stars of
this movie? It is sort of nostalgic- I&#x27;ll give it that. And I&#x27;m not
even too mad at the casting choices for any of the main roles. My main
concern is with SUCH a big budget for this and after the success of the
live-action Jungle Book-- how could a classic like this be given such
bad treatment? The CGI was honestly horrendous. I felt it difficult to
call this live-action when everything that surrounded the human
characters seemed like a really bad theatre set- they didn&#x27;t even feel
like they&#x27;re in a small, French town. If you&#x27;re going to really push
the CGI route- go full throttle. Don&#x27;t use it on places that you need
it the least- like the Beast&#x27;s face for example. I&#x27;m familiar with Dan
Stevens and I could see some of the facial remarks and quirks were him-
but that&#x27;s it. Otherwise, it could have been anyone. It looked like
Belle was speaking to a green screen throughout the entire movie. I
also didn&#x27;t love Lumiere&#x27;s Liberace-esque redesign. But overall-
Lumiere and Cogsworth were enjoyable for the most part and Be Our Guest
was BY FAR the saving grace as far as the musical numbers were
concerned.If they wanted to do BATB in modern times or re-imagine it- go with it.
Go that route. But take it all the way there. I don&#x27;t think it was a
good idea to try and keep the script the same in literally 90% of the
movie only to add in a handful of unnecessary extra songs (which
weren&#x27;t actually any good- especially Beast&#x27;s), the back story of
Belle&#x27;s mom which really did not add anything special to the story and
the need to alter the ending by adding in the &#x27;hideous wench&#x27;
character. What was the point of that? Stick to the original or
reinvent it. I didn&#x27;t mine the slight addition of insinuated gayness of
LeFou- I thought it was quite entertaining and very Waylon Smithers/Mr.
Burns-esque. I don&#x27;t understand the uproar, quite frankly. Besides-
it&#x27;s 2017. Can people finally just stop? Being gay isn&#x27;t a new
phenomenon, folks. Just ask Napoleon.The classic songs felt incredibly flat for me- especially Bonjour. I
agree with another review that I didn&#x27;t understand nor particularly
like the odd delays in the song- what was the point? And also, she just
didn&#x27;t really seem to sing with much effort. I like Emma as an actress
in most scenarios (I try to forget that she did Bling Ring- arg) but it
felt very much like Emma playing the role of Belle in a theatre
production- I didn&#x27;t feel as though she really embodied the character
in any way. The stand outs- by far- were Luke Evans and Josh Gad. I
don&#x27;t think they could have done better casting for those roles no
matter if you enjoyed the characters or not.Another thing that felt incredibly dull to me was the colors. I
remember seeing the cartoon version of Belle in her glowing, golden
dress that was SO beautiful and well-constructed that it honestly just
made Emma Watson seem like she was wrapped up in her grandmother&#x27;s
curtains. Like, who did that? If you&#x27;re going to do ANYTHING the
service that it deserves- you can&#x27;t lack on Belle&#x27;s dress and that
entire Beauty &#x26; the Beast dance sequence. It was flat. Where were the
colours and the incredible camera angles? I remember one specific
&#x22;camera shot&#x22; that swirled around them in the Disney cartoon version
where you could also see the rest of the ballroom- I still feel
goosebumps. One of the most beautiful scenes I&#x27;ve ever seen.And lastly- Mrs. Potts&#x27; animation was just plain scary to me.That is all.Twitter: @steacyc
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Bit Disappointing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would! However, there
are a lot of problems. I did like how it gave us more detail into the
curse. It also added more to the curse, how when each petal falls the
castle starts to crumble and the staff become more and more less human.
It really added to their desperation. I loved the piano and the
wardrobe characters. It was also nice to see some diversity!! The costumes were fantastic, apart from the yellow dress. I was so
disappointed. The girls at conventions can make an exact copy, why
can&#x27;t Disney with a budget of millions? It did not need a 2 hour run
time, the parts about Belle&#x27;s mother could have been cut out. It was
nice to know but it added 0 to the story. The best character was Gaston
played by Luke Evans. I thought he was fantastic! He really brought the
character to life. The Beast wasn&#x27;t right imo. I didn&#x27;t really feel
anything towards him, in the cartoon the audience can see straight away
that he feels guilty about having kept Belle from saying goodbye to her
father, he gives her the library etc.You really see his sweet side.
However in the live action remake we don&#x27;t see this, he doesn&#x27;t give
her the library as a gift he just short of shrugs and says something
along the lines of &#x22;you can&#x27;t have it if you want whatever&#x22;. There
isn&#x27;t any reason for Belle to fall in love with him. The songs are
great and creative, especially Be Our Guest, but the new added songs
are dull and forgettable. The magic book was so pointless, it added
nothing to the story, in fact it created a small problem. When Belle
sees her father in the magic mirror, she runs off on the horse, but if
the Beast had the book which could take them anywhere, why would she
run all the way home? At least if she did that we wouldn&#x27;t have to sit
through the Beat&#x27;s song. I was disappointed with the dance scene, there
is a great part in the original where the &#x22;camera&#x22; pans down from the
chandelier and ends up on the floor as the dance past, for an animated
film it is such an achievement and it&#x27;s a wonderful scene; I was
disappointed that they didn&#x27;t include that famous shot. Again the dress
was a let down. I think the cast was great and all the voice actors did a great job!
Apart from Emma Watson, her face was dull, she had a really fake smile
during Be Our Guest which was a shame because Belle is really into the
routine in the cartoon. Also, when Beast transforms back into the
Prince, she&#x27;s just stood watching with a face like Kirsten Stewart,
she&#x27;s not really in awe or surprised that this is happening right in
front of her eyes. The cartoon is so bright and vibrant, it&#x27;s a wonder
to watch. This however, the colour palette was great for the first 20
minutes, but it was really dull for the rest of the movie, which I know
they wanted to make a &#x22;darker&#x22; version but I don&#x27;t think it really
worked in this case. Conclusion: It was OK - but the original cartoon is much better.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As you are all aware Disney is rebooting all of its cartoon classics
and bringing them to life. The last one they rebooted was &#x22;the Jungle
Book&#x22; and that was so close to perfection. Sadly Beauty And The Beast
is a downfall from that. Jay And Nick (The Autistic Reviewers) will
start off this review by starting out with the bad and then ending with
the good. We always like to leave on a positive note! The Bad: There
are some horrible moments of CGI such as The Beasts face, the wolves
and Lumiere (in some scenes). The face of the Beast was just lazy.
Don&#x27;t think it had anything to do with the CGI...after all if Peter
Jackson&#x27;s 2005 version of Kong can look so real there is no reason that
The Beasts face could have been done the same or even better. The eyes
of the beast are also a problem. The eyes just don&#x27;t go with the CGI
face. You could either make the CGI better or just put a guy in a
costume. Lumiere (Ewan McGregor)and Cogsworth (Ian Mckellen) were
completely miscast. They didn&#x27;t capture the charm and humour the
original Lumiere and Cogsworth did. Audra Mcdonald who plays Madame
Garderobe was annoying as hell. In fact without going too far into the
voice cast just didn&#x27;t capture the heart nor the charm of the original
voice actors did with these characters. One of the biggest complaints
of this movie was casting Emma Watson as Belle. She just seemed
completely fake and kept looking away from the camera all the time as
if she was saying to the director &#x22;Am I doing this right? Am I doing
this right? Am I supposed to feel this way?&#x22; We always pictured someone
like Emma Stone or Rachel Mcadams playing someone like Belle. One other
big complaint is the director. The direction was awful. It felt like a
Twilight movie, and looking at the directors history of directing he
did, in fact direct the finale 2 Twilight Movies. It just did not fit.The good: The singing and the soundtrack was really good. It had songs
from the original movie and even 1 or 2 extra songs thrown in there for
entertainment purposes and it does work. Luke Evans as Gaston was the
perfect choice. He relive Gaston not only as a bully like he was in the
original, but also as a murdering, short tempered man. Josh Gad as
Lefou was also another good choice for casting. Him and Luke Evans
looked like they knew what they were doing and were having great fun
bringing their characters to life. More good news is that Emma Thompson
(who plays Mrs. Potts) was the perfect choice to play her. She was he
only voice that was convincing and her singing was really good.Verdict: With a better director and a better actress to play Belle and
many others this film could have been saved and made into an excellent
reboot like The Jungle Book, but sadly it didn&#x27;t end up that way. The
Autistic Reviewers give this 2/5 stars. 5/10. Check us out on facebook

Cast was created and worked hard. I seen the movie and enjoyed it. All
I hear from ratings these days from people is hatred, spoiled brats,
and bunch of stuck ups. If you don&#x27;t like the movie and you have to
bash people that still worked hard on set, then you should go act on
the movie set and close your disgraceful mouths of outrageous childish
behavior. They worked on hard on set, I like the movie, and the
romance. Still stuff to be liked. You reviewers outta be ashamed of
your selves with such childish review.

Emma Watson played quite horrible... I didn&#x27;t say she is just a bad
actress or something like that, but I&#x27;ve the idea she didn&#x27;t put much
time on characters she is gonna play. She has pretty looks
viid.me/qQJp2O but that&#x27;s it. On the contrary, Luke Evans and Dan
Stevens played their character good!Sorry Emma Watson fans...
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Unexpected scene<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
To be honest, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all that they&#x27;ve tried to make the
exact...well.. almost exact copy of the Disney&#x27;s Masterpiece:&#x22;Beauty
and the Beast&#x22;. I was eager to watch it with my kids (thinking it was a
family movie!), but to my surprise, there was GAY SCENES!!!! I 100
percent prefer the animated one/Due to that, i couldn&#x27;t enjoy the movie and shouldn&#x27;t be categorized
with family movies.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An exact copy of the classic original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Ever since Disney made a live action remake of the jungle book, they
have been making remakes of our childhood films,and hope to continue
doing that. And then you have this movie. We all know the story, A
beautiful girl stumbles across a castle with talking house hold items
and a beast, but soon enough they grow to love each other. I really
liked all the people in this movie, they did a good job at playing
their roles, whether they were a mild mannered tea cup, or a hairy
creature. The special effects were good, and most of the musical
numbers were great. However all the people and the music does not make
up for the same exact story as the animated classic. I enjoyed The
Jungle Book and Pete&#x27;s Dragon because all though they had some of the
same elements, they boosted enough new elements and a new plot to keep
the story going. While this movie doesn&#x27;t do that at all. I expected
some things do be different but it gave me the same characters, same
plot, and mostly the same musical numbers. Hell they even had the same
dialogue. So in the end, Beauty and the Beast may have some enjoyable
moments, but that is not enough to keep us engaged when all it is an
exact copy of the classic original. C- or 5/10. Face it the only reason
they made this film was to put more money into Disney&#x27;s pockets.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The best thing about the movie are the costumes and listening Ewan McGregor sing again, after 16 years<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
These 2 things besides Emma Thompson are the only good things. The rest
of the movie is, if I remember well, identical to the animated version,
but with less charm.The performance of Emma Watson is a bit bad, at the level of those
performances in children&#x27;s birthday. Luke Evans as Gaston is lousy, has
no other adjective and the way Josh Gad as LeFou play a gay character
is too clich&#xE9;.The rest is CGI and bad funny scenes. Conclusion...go to see it, only
if you are invited and someone pay your ticket.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>SOOOOOOO boring<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It was so dull and boring . Though they tried to be as loyal as
possible to the original animation ,but not much success ! Emma Watson
was horrible , Bad acting and unreal sweetness was an insult to lovely
Belle . Her feelings toward Beast even after he became prince charming
were super fake ... So sad she will present Belle in our children&#x27;s
mind.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>No idea how reviews are as good as they are.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
*SPOILERS* Let me just say, I came into this movie ready to hate it.
The original classic is my second favorite Disney movie ever (Aladdin
being the first), and based on my distaste for Cinderella and the cash
cow that is Disney trying to milk all the money it can from a popular
property annoys the hell out of me. But, as it would happen, I enjoyed
myself more than I thought. However, this was a low, LOW bar to clear.
Let me start off with the good: Kevin Kline as the father. I thought he
did a really good job and I totally bought the relationship between him
and Belle. Josh Gad as Lefou. Honestly, he was hilarious in this movie,
and the scene in which he&#x27;s singing in Gaston&#x27;s tavern brought about a
moment I can&#x27;t spoil here because of it&#x27;s hilarity. The movie on that
note is also very funny, I did find myself laughing ore than once or
twice during the film. I also thought the voice acting for the objects
was good, especially the man who played Lumiere. The casting, overall,
was OK. I could see Emma Watson as Belle, and the guy who played Gaston
was fun enough to watch. But now we get into the bad stuff. The
singing. For the most part it&#x27;s pretty good, except for one person, and
this is the fatal flaw, and that is Emma Watson as Belle. All
throughout the movie you can tell whenever she sang the auto-tune was
cranked up to 11, because her voice never sounds human. Honestly, this
brought her performance down a lot for me. Then there&#x27;s the sound
design itself. In the beginning, there was a song that was going on,
but the background noise was so much that I could barely hear what they
were saying, and that continued a lot throughout the entire movie. Then
there those CGI effects. Good God on green Earth, I hated how fake
everything looked in the movie. In an animated realm, everyone can work
off each other. In live action, human actors are there looking at balls
of Play-doh or whatever they use to see the effects, and none of them
ever looked real or alive. There is an especially weird addition with
having the feather duster be a dove(?) And the worst sin of all is the
main characters themselves, the Beast and Belle. First of all, to go
along with the effects subject, the beast looks terrible. His face
looks the weirdest because it looks like the CGI animators tried to
give him an almost humanoid face, which DIDN&#x27;T work. But first let&#x27;s
talk bout him as a character. When Belle is forced to stay in the
castle, he shows sympathy by giving her a nice bedroom and ATTEMPTING
to invite her to dinner. However, in this version, you see none of that
sympathy. Instead, the objects get her from the dungeon, they provide
with a bedroom. Hell, he gets outright furious with Lumiere and
Cogsworth for providing her with a room. With all this sympathy taken
away from him, it&#x27;s really hard for me to buy the romance between the
Beast and Belle.They also try to delve into a backstory of his, saying
he had a cruel father, but the most &#x22;delving&#x22; they do is just
mentioning that he had a cruel father. And then there is Belle. In the
original, she&#x27;s a smart, kind, and loving person. Here, I actually saw
her someone of a jerk. When Gaston, who isn&#x27;t nearly as douchey as he
should be in the movie, kindly asks her to dinner, she denies him like
some Mean Girls pre-Madonna. She also has almost no life or personality
throughout the entire movie. Overall, Beauty and the Beast 2017 was a
shameless cash grab with none of the heart or charm of the original
movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Awful!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Please don&#x27;t waste your time/money on this mess of a movie. Go out and
buy the animated version and have a great time. I still cannot believe
how bad the &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; number was. It should have been a delight
and was just a hot mess. I just could not finish watching this! So
sorry I wasted $5.99 of my hard-earned money.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It was okay.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
STRENGTHS: The songs were good, especially the new ones. The story was
good too as the movie filled up the empty spaces from the animated
version. For instance, they explained the villagers&#x27; knowledge about
the castle and the Royal Family, Belle&#x27;s mother, the Beast&#x27;s attitude,
etc. It became more realistic in terms of story and character.
Well...it IS the live-action version. The visuals were nice, the castle
was good. The song gems were the Belle song and the Gaston Song. One of
the great things they did here is that they really made the beast a
prince, like his &#x22;expensive education&#x22; LOL they didn&#x27;t remember that
during the 1991 film where the beast was reading with Belle and he
pronounced &#x22;Two&#x22; wrong. That was ridiculous.By the way, a big applause for Luke Evans here. Josh Groban&#x27;s Evermore?
BeautifulWEAKNESSES: They have quick pacing of dialogue or line throwing I
guess... To those who have watched the 1991 beauty and the beast will
definitely notice this, because they often did it to the familiar lines
from the 1991 film. And yes I know that time is money... but still,
there are a lot of moments where they just throw the lines without
having a normal and human conversation pace. I&#x27;m not saying always, but
often. I&#x27;m just saying... it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re being chased or something.Madame Garderobe&#x27;s singing is annoying sometimes. It was good at the
starting song, but it then it kind of ruined the song, Days in the Sun
and &#x22;Tale as Old as Time&#x22; at the finale. Belle&#x27;s voice? Too auto-tuned
LOL. It was like there was no absolute room for flaws. Belle&#x27;s Dress?
Disappointing. They did the effort with these magical effects for the
designs with Garderobe, but it was still ugly. Sorry. I have nothing
more to say to Ariana and John&#x27;s karaoke session in Beauty and the
Beast. It was tragic. For Celine Dion&#x27;s &#x22;How Does A Moment..&#x22;, it was a
great rendition, BUT her accent got stronger, so you couldn&#x27;t
understand some lyrics.As usual, the Be Our Guest song was too lengthy and dragging.Overall, the film was okay. I would not want to compare the 1991
version to this one because they both have good points and bad points.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not bad!  But, it&#x27;s going to suffer by inevitable comparison to the 1991 original.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Yes, I went to see it out of curiosity (like a lot of you, I suspect).
But, while it adhered pretty closely to the Menken/Ashman masterpiece
of twenty-six years ago, it still didn&#x27;t recapture the charm and
novelty of it. Not for me, anyway.Ewan McGregor, as Lumiere, is no Jerry Orbach. Emma Thompson, as Mrs.
Potts, is no Angela Lansbury. Ian McKellen sounded more like Patrick
Stewart (his co-star from the X-MEN films) rather than Charles Ogden
Stiers (the voice of the original Cogswell). And Emma Stone? Well, her
song coach should be proud of her. But, she&#x27;s still no Catherine
O&#x27;Hara.All in all, then, it was a nice way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon.
But, I sincerely doubt this will be the Oscar contender, at next year&#x27;s
Academy Awards, the same way the original movie was.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Live Show and Movie is Different<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I saw with Live Show of Disney When it performed in India Last Year and
Loved that a lot. I decided to go for the show in the impression that
it will be broadly on the basis on that show itself. The basic idea
matched with the film but the detailed story line varies a lot. Review
is for those who has seen Live show in India, they may feel
disappointed.

To be honest, I never found the animated movie as spellbinding as
everyone else. I never owned the VHS as a child. I really liked it and
there were a lot of great things about it, but I preferred other films. This live action version manages to correct a few mistakes, but also
leave out some things and add new ones that weren&#x27;t necessary. The set is beautiful, and the song and dance routines are very
energetic. The characters are rendered more realistic and three
dimensional with extra back stories. What I thought was the best change was the character of LeFou. He is
not really a villain in this film, more like a very sweet guy who
happens to worship and be in love with a very bad man (Gaston).The same could not be said of the Beast. I kind of prefer it in the
animated version. There were things left out and things added that were
both good and bad, but ultimately didn&#x27;t leave much of an impact as I
thought.Another thing I thought was missing was the hilarious banter between
Lumi&#xE8;re and Cogsworth (&#x22;En Garde you overgrown pocket watch!&#x22;). Overall, it&#x27;s a sweet and beautiful tribute and expansion to the
cartoon version, but probably not enough to make it stand out on its
own.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It&#x27;s serviceable.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;m not a huge fan or musicals to be honest, but every now and then I
find myself to be entertained by some of them. That being said when I was a child I enjoyed a few Disney animation
classics and Beauty &#x26; the Beast is definitely one of them. During the
hype train I found myself anticipating the film the more I heard about
it. Emma Watson&#x27;s casting as Belle definitely brought my attention to
the film. As did the casting Ewan McGergor, Sir Ian McKellen, Stanley
Tucci, and Emma Thompson. The set photos and promotional images also
grabbed my attention too.I&#x27;m happy to report that it&#x27;s a serviceable adaptation of the animated
movie. Most of the cast delivers with the exception of Luke Evans. He
definitely looks like he&#x27;s having fun in the role as Gaston, but he is
so cartoonishly two-dimensional and so over the top. I just could not
take him seriously every time he showed up on screen. Aside from him
everyone does a great job. Emma Watson brings it, and her singing isn&#x27;t
too bad either. Stand out for me was Ewan McGergor as Lumiere. He
brought a lot of swagger and personality to the role. His banter and
exchange with Ian McKellen&#x27;s Cogsworth brings a lot of humor in their
relationship. I also really enjoyed Dan Steven&#x27;s performance as the
Beast. Singing in the beginning of the film is a little bit of a turn-off. Not
because the actors couldn&#x27;t sing, but it&#x27;s one number after another,
and some of the verses were kind of pointless as well. But once the
plot gets going it becomes more tolerable. In the middle near to the
end, the film know when to pick it&#x27;s moments to showcase a number. Like
I said I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of musicals, but the annoyance is only
temporary. Some of the actors are kinda there without much to do,
despite some amusing moments, like Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, Audra
McDonald, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. The romance is solid. It never felt too over the top, and the chemistry
for the most part was there. I believe making people laugh and
showcasing romance is something hard to convey for any movie. Beauty &#x26;
the Beast does a commendable job at it, however while I never felt like
Belle and Beast&#x27;s relationship felt force, I wish that a little more
was given to them. The film does showcase their bonding, but most of it
are montages. Everything set up for their romance was just almost,
almost executed with perfection. I also wish I got to see more out of
Dan Steven&#x27;s Beast as well. The film hits in high gears once the film
introduces him. Special effects and production design are first rate. Yes there are
moments where you can tell it&#x27;s CGI, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable that
it&#x27;s going to distract you. Costumes are fabulous too look at and the
actors are well lit. Director Bill Condon does an excellent job
showcasing the fantasy land, it&#x27;s visually pleasing and enriching. The
ball-room dance sequence with Beast and Belle is done with justice too.At times Beauty &#x26; the Beast can feel cluttered and overproduced
eye-candy, but the film is a very faithful adaptation of the animated
film. Aside from a little backstory from Belle and the gay character
LeFou played by Josh Gad(which is handled well to be honest), it really
doesn&#x27;t bring a lot new to the table. Which is fine for some, cause why
fix what isn&#x27;t broken, but that works for and against the film. Among other live adaptations, I&#x27;d rank this below or evenly with
Cinderella, but definitely much more entertaining than Maleficent or
the Alice in Wonderland films. Odd that both Cinderella and Beauty &#x26;
the Beast are basic retellings that work for the most part, but
Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland try to be new re-imaginings that
just crumble. Perhaps Little Mermaid or Mulan might find the striking
balance of both. 6.6/10

I have re-watched this in theaters this weekend, so I come fresh with
this movie in mind. Having said that, my perception of this movie has not changed. I will
also add that this story was my favorite Disney story growing up.
Having watched it twice now, my experience has remained the same. I
still got lost in the story, the imagery, the music, and the singing. The plot was almost completely the same as that of the cartoon version,
with a few additions. I very much loved these new additions as they
added depth to the story and closed some plot holes. It also helped to
better establish the relationship between Belle and the Beast. P.S. Loved the gay millisecond! I don&#x27;t know what all the fuss was
about.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappoint movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it&#x27;s their
masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a recent version was in
the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was
shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed
singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst
CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages. This movie is the
disappoint.When the prince refuses the rose from stranger and stranger turn to
fairy, she transforms him into a monstrous beast and his servants into
household objects, and erases the castle from the memories of their
loved ones. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that,
unless he learns to love another and earn their love in return before
the last petal falls, he and his servants will lose their humanity
forever.Lost in the forest, Belle&#x27;s father Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast&#x27;s
castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose. Belle ventures
out in search for him and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The
Beast agrees to let her take Maurice&#x27;s place (her father place).Belle befriends the castle&#x27;s servants, who treat her to a spectacular
dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the
rose, the Beast, enraged, scares her into the woods. She is cornered by
wolves, but the Beast rescues her and is injured in the process. A
friendship develops as Belle nurses his wounds. The Beast shows Belle a
gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they
want. Belle uses it to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she
discovers a plague doctor mask. Belle realizes that she and her father
were forced to leave her mother&#x27;s deathbed because of her mother
succumbed to the plague. Bell&#x27;s father come back to village to seek the
help, but no one believe him. Gaston sees rescuing Belle as an
opportunity to win her hand in marriage and agrees to help Maurice.
However, when Gaston go with Bell&#x27;s father to forest, he loses temper
because bell&#x27;s father forgot the way to beast castle; Gaston then
abandons him to the wolves. Maurice is rescued by a beggar, but when he
tells the townsfolk of Gaston&#x27;s crime, Gaston convinces them to send
him to an insane asylum. After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast,
Belle discovers her father&#x27;s predicament using a magic mirror. The
Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember
him with. At Villeneuve, Belle proves Maurice&#x27;s sanity by revealing the
Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk. Realizing that Belle loves the
Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father
and rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the
Beast. Maurice and Belle escape and Belle rushes back to the castle.During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who sides with
the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his
tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his will upon
seeing Belle return. He spares Gaston&#x27;s life before reuniting with
Belle. However, Gaston shoots the Beast from a bridge, but it collapses
when the castle crumbles and he falls to his death. The Beast dies as
the last petal falls and the servants become inanimate. When Belle
tearfully professes her love to him, Agathe reveals herself as the
enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle and
restoring the Beast&#x27;s and servants&#x27; human forms and the villagers&#x27;
memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they
dance happily.

Many had high expectations, considering the original was a masterpiece.
I found it pretty average, costumes and sets were beautifully done but
that&#x27;s where it goes downhill for me. To be honest, it annoyed me Emma
Watson&#x27;s voice was so auto-tuned and her acting was overall mediocre.
The only actors I did enjoy was Josh Gad (LeFou) and Luke Evans
(Gaston), and Gaston was the only remade song I liked. I wasn&#x27;t into
the new content added to the story line, besides Evermore. To sum up, I
kind of liked it as a movie on its own, but I didn&#x27;t like it as a
remake.

I had high hopes, I really did. I won&#x27;t leave a lengthy review but
between the LGBT undertones which are very much apparent, the
feminization of both The Beast and Gastton and numerous other problems,
this movie is pure dog crap. I loved the original cartoon and if you
love it to stay the hell away from this turd. Don&#x27;t just take my word
for it. Read all of the other reviews and save your money and two hours
of your life!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It&#x27;s the original animated movie...just higher definition of the same thing again.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The magical 1991 animated tale is being told again, only this time in
&#x27;live-action&#x27;. The movie stars Emma Watson as Belle who finds herself
imprisoned by a beastly creature in a cursed castle (Dan Stevens). The
two obviously at first start out at odds, but over time learn to look
past their differences and become fond of one another to the point
where they may have achieved a love that could break the spell over the
castle and everyone who inhabits it.I didn&#x27;t like it... I think the movie itself is fine. There really
isn&#x27;t that much wrong with the actual picture; it&#x27;s well made, well
directed, looks pretty, acted fine, songs (for the most part) are the
same and decent, it has a few good laughs, the CGI is mostly done
alright. My real gripes about this movie is that, aside from
approximately 15 minutes worth of material, it is exactly the same as
the 1991 animated movie of the same name. It is as close as a movie can
get to being a &#x27;shot-for-shot&#x27; remake without reaching quite to the
extent of Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &#x22;Psycho&#x22;. There isn&#x27;t any real originality to
this movie, it rips off every single scene, all the songs and lines of
dialog from the original and makes it &#x22;live- action&#x22;, which even then
it&#x27;s not really live-action since the majority of the film is done with
CGI. Granted, a lot of the CGI looks fine, but some of it looked a
little...creepy. Anyways, I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s a bad film but that is only because it
follows the original so closely so of course it isn&#x27;t bad. But if I
want to watch the exact same movie again then I&#x27;ll pop in the 1991
movie that feels way more genuine than this remake. I was able to feel
way more of the enchantment and charm of the cartoon than I was with
this movie. With this movie, all I was able to feel was the cynical
attitude of the producers basically saying &#x22;Well, if we make the exact
same movie again then we don&#x27;t have to think up anything new and the
audiences will be happy because they&#x27;re seeing the same movie all over
again that they could easily watch at home but this time they have to
give us money for it...Genius!&#x22; That&#x27;s what this movie feels like, it&#x27;s
lazy on the part of the writers and producers to make this movie
because they already had the movie made for them once before, all they
had to do was copy and paste. Yeah, there is a few different scenes and
songs scattered around but they either stick out like a sore thumb or
don&#x27;t make any difference to the overall story anyways so it became
pointless. This whole remake&#x27;s existence is pointless because it&#x27;s
already been done before and done way better. It&#x27;s a manufactured,
lifeless product rather than an endearing and magical love story like
before.I love the original, I really do. And I can see why people would like
this movie; like I said before, it&#x27;s not a bad film, I just have a
problem with studios being so lazy that they don&#x27;t even bother taking
the time to come up with a new or different adaptation of the material.
They&#x27;d rather ride the success of the original movie by doing the same
thing again, and it worked. And I understand that this is completely
subjective, so if that doesn&#x27;t bother you then fine. Personally, I&#x27;m
under the opinion that if a remake isn&#x27;t doing something in order to
justify its reasons for existing then it&#x27;s pointless. If a remake is
only going to do exactly what the original movie did then I&#x27;ll just
watch the original instead. Now if this movie tried putting a different
spin on things, or expanded much more on the characters, maybe taking a
unique direction, changing things up in the story that possibly could
play on expectations; then I would see a reason for this movie being
made, however as it is, it&#x27;s a lesser and longer version of a classic
Disney masterpiece. I know that I&#x27;ve been extremely harsh on the movie, but the movie
itself really is fine. Technically speaking, there isn&#x27;t that much
about it that&#x27;s necessarily bad. Emma Watson does fine in the role of
Belle, although I don&#x27;t think she has a particularly strong singing
voice. Dan Stevens I already just naturally like, he has a good on
screen presence in about everything I&#x27;ve seen him in and he does well
as the Beast. Kevin Kline I always love to see in movies, besides
&#x22;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&#x22; I don&#x27;t get to see him in much so I&#x27;m glad that he
played Maurice since he can balance kooky and lovable so easily. Luke
Evans and Josh Gad as Gaston and LeFou were pretty great actually. They
were a big reason why I laughed as much as I did while watching the
movie. Moving on. The songs from the original are still catchy and charming,
the new songs I honestly can&#x27;t remember what they sounded like; I
remember where they pop up in the story, but not so much their melodies
or lyrics...so I guess they&#x27;re...fine? Maybe? The movie looks very
pretty; the set designs and costumes are visually interesting, the
special effects are mainly done well, and there are some decently shot
sequences. So I say if you end up watching this, you&#x27;ll probably have a
good time with it and it&#x27;s fine to show to your kids for sure. If and
when I have kids though, the remake won&#x27;t be the first thing I show
them. It will be the animated film and the remake will probably never
make it into my movie collection so...woops...I guess they won&#x27;t get
the privilege of seeing that one...oh no

When I first heard they were going to do a live actor remake of Beauty
and the Beast I thought it was a good idea - except what they remade
was Belle, her father, etc as live actors and filled in all the
characters at the castle with CGI. The candlestick, the clock, the
teapot and the beast were all cartoonish CGI, except not with the
joy/fun of the original. Even the music seemed stale. So bottom line,
not the worst movie but certainly not a great one.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A movie you will enjoy if you like musicals and Disney<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Since I knew about this production I was anxious of seeing it.
Especially after watching &#x22;The Jungle Book&#x22;, which impressed me a lot
because of the incredible special effects. I had very high expectations
about this movie. Even tho I loved the movie there were some details
that I didn&#x27;t like that much and some others that in my opinion were
very clever because helped getting in the mood of this fairy tale and
the made it a little bit more &#x22;real&#x22;. But, before getting into that, I
would like to talk about one of the topics of the film which is the
relationships between characters. I liked that in this film you can see
different types of relationships (mother and son, best friends,
lovers...) that could perfectly represent relations of your daily life.
In my case this made me think about my friend and family. What I most
liked about the movie were the scenery, which I found charming; the
costumes, some of them were incredibly beautiful and very accurate; and
that in the film are explained details (like why was winter in the
castle or what happened to Belle&#x27;s mother) that weren&#x27;t in the previous
film. I also loved most of the cast specially Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor,
Luke Evans and Audra McDonald. I really appreciate the fact that some
scenes were exactly like in the cartoon film of 1991 and that they took
back some details that did not appear in the previous film but were in
the first book (which author has the same name that the village in this
new film). However, there were some things which I did not enjoy the
most, for example, in this film was not included the song &#x22;If I can&#x27;t
love her&#x22; that in my opinion is the best of the whole musical. Instead
the have created I knew song called &#x22;Evermore&#x22;. I wouldn&#x27;t say that
it&#x27;s an awful song, but the other one is definitely better.
Nevertheless, I loved the song &#x22;Days in he sun&#x22; that they also created
for this film. I would have loved if the had recorded the song while
they were acting, like it was done in &#x22;Les Miserables&#x22;. Due to I think
that would have made the songs transmit a lot more emotion. In truth,
this was a movie that I really enjoyed watching and that ended up
complying with most of my expectations. I recommend this film, owing to
is not too heavy and is that kind of film that will make you leave the
cinema smiling.

Watching Bill Condon&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast as an adult is like running
into your best friend from grade school at a bar. They&#x27;re hammered,
decked out in a circa 2001 Avril Lavigne Sk8ter Boi outfit and
faux-hawk, but surprise: they work as an insurance claims adjuster, and
make awkward, drunken conversation about linoleum. Yep. Hear me out.
Heady nostalgia, amusement (both uncomfortable and sincere), but all
tampered by a vaguely alienating sense of antiquated tackiness and
boredom. This is your old friend, and you&#x27;ll always love them in spite
of... them. But did you really need to run into them again like...
this? This is the battle of Beauty and the Beast 2.0: not as beastly as
your worst fears would have it, but a far cry from the beauty that once
was. &#x27;Tale as old as time&#x27; doesn&#x27;t work as well when it&#x27;s a tale barely
older than the average viewer, begetting the invariable &#x27;Too Soon!&#x27;
griping. Sadly, in this case, the peanut gallery may be justified. It&#x27;s
rare to see a film tiptoeing around its fan following so fearfully,
every frame oozing desperation to validate its own existence. From the
first notes of the soundtrack, there&#x27;s an uneasy balance between near
shot-for-shot slavishness and defiant new beats. But, for every closed
plot hole (so THAT&#x27;S why no one in the village noticed the gigantic,
deserted castle!), there&#x27;s awkward, superfluous character exposition
(did Belle really need to be saddled with a &#x27;disappeared parent&#x27;
subplot, a-la Amazing Spider-Man?). The original songs are, naturally,
too darn good not to make hearts soar, but they&#x27;re staged with varying
degrees of imagination and vibrancy. New tunes range from cutely
forgettable to downright cringe-worthy (let&#x27;s just say the Beast&#x27;s solo
romantic ballad plays better on Broadway...), while inexcusably lame
tweaks to Gaston&#x27;s legendarily raucous tavern ditty will have you
pulling out every last inch of you covered in hair. And so on. More
than almost any adaptation, Condon courts an invariable game of
constant compare/contrast that he&#x27;s fated to lose (would you want to go
toe-to-toe with the first animated Best Picture nominee?), conjuring an
audience commentary of &#x22;Meh, that was better in the original&#x22; to &#x22;Did
we really need that?&#x22; Throw in some lurching pacing - how can a film 40
minutes longer than its predecessor feel so much more rushed? - and
staid, wooden sensibilities, with only glimmers of the original&#x27;s
whimsy or the playfulness of 2016&#x27;s Jungle Book, and you&#x27;ve got one
squirmy audience. It&#x27;s a shame, because Condon&#x27;s fairy tale unearths plenty of magic when
it&#x27;s allowed to breathe. If there&#x27;s one strain that feels fully fleshed
out in live action, it&#x27;s the poor provincial town&#x27;s bullying of Belle,
seeing her unmarried, innovative intellect as beyond &#x27;odd,&#x27; but as a
downright ideological threat verging on witchcraft. It&#x27;s this focal
point that lends surprising sincerity and sweetness to her budding
romance with her ferocious captor - she connects with him as a fellow
outsider, passionate, but fearfully clueless about how to societally
integrate. Condon also finds surprising poignancy in the Beast&#x27;s
household workers resigned to living as animated objects as penance for
taking no accountability in preventing his warped, cruelly spoiled
upbringing. A subtle nature/nurture conversation of a social
environment&#x27;s power to corrupt through passive-aggressive teasing or
shameful inactivity? Now that feels like classic Disney! If the prospect of 2017 special effects bringing the magic to life were
a selling point, it&#x27;s still a mixed bag. It&#x27;s ironic that the film&#x27;s
prologue cautions against gaudy, superficial excess, as Condon&#x27;s film
is almost exhaustingly lavish, but too loud and busy to settle into the
painstaking elegance of its predecessor. The surreal twisty, Jean
Cocteau decor is pleasingly intricate, but almost perennially muted by
murky, grey lighting, while the vaguely creepy anthropomorphic
household utensils take considerable acclimatizing to. Even the &#x27;Be Our
Guest&#x27; showstopper manages the paradox of looking ferociously expensive
but oddly unspectacular. Still - Condon does nail The Dance, and it
alone is transcendently lovely enough to keep the film afloat, and then
some. No, you&#x27;re twirling around humming the theme. Hmmpff. You want to love Emma Watson&#x27;s Belle. You really do. But, Hermione
hangover aside, she feels distressingly miscast - as sullen and sunken
as her wincingly autotuned singing voice, she&#x27;s too caustic to capture
more than dribbles of Belle&#x27;s warmth, spunkiness, and bubbly
braininess. Trading Harry for Hairy, Dan Stevens makes a superb Beast,
dubious CGI aside. His Beast is a grumbling hipster, his former effete
condescension bleeding into his brooding making his character arc all
the more charmingly self-aware. Though far from the size of a barge (no
&#x22;biceps to spare&#x22; here, amusingly), Luke Evans swings solidly at
Gaston&#x27;s seismic chauvinism. But, although he hits the musical notes,
he&#x27;s too tentative a scene-chewer, and lacks the thunderous charisma to
properly sell the narrative&#x27;s masterful deconstruction of toxic
masculinity (it&#x27;s no wonder LeFou has to bribe these townspeople to -
literally - sing his praises). Speaking of: 10 points to Josh Gad,
singlehandedly stealing the show with a pitch-perfect deluge of
adorably fawning silliness. While Kevin Kline&#x27;s softly quirky Maurice
is pleasantly winning, his additional screen time adds little to the
film. Indeed, most of the comedic and emotional lifting is left to the
charming voice cast, and Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson,
Stanley Tucci, and others all brim with the mountainous charm and
silliness you&#x27;d hope for. There is beauty within Condon&#x27;s film, but it&#x27;s largely enshrouded by
oodles of overstuffed visual dazzle and fumbling mimesis that fail to
disguise the the film&#x27;s heart isn&#x27;t quite there. It&#x27;s an amiable
diversion, but a worthwhile remake? Let&#x27;s just say time won&#x27;t be kind
to this tale. But let&#x27;s be honest: it&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast. Reviews
or not, you&#x27;re probably going to obstinately check it out anyway,
muttering &#x22;surely it can&#x27;t be as bad as all that.&#x22; And you know what?
Be my guest.-6.5/10

I am quiet surprised when Emma did not sing so well cause it is
supposed to be a musical film. Except for that, costumes design and all
the other scenes in the film is quiet remarkable. Anyway, fairy tale
has to be fairy tale, if we made it real the selection of the actress
has to be more demanding. Get a little disappointed when the smart
erudite little girl Belle in the childhood story is acted like a
beautiful dressed not so smart girl in the movie.

I love this all time Disney story, however...I can&#x27;t say I loved the
movie. I like it but not loved it. I loved seeing it in 3D...it was
great looking at the scenery jump out and put you right there. Belle
has a higher voice but Emma did a good job. The tavern scene in the
beginning seemed weird, can&#x27;t explain it. One or two new songs were
added that seemed unneeded. My biggest pet peeve is that this is a
Disney movie...so to watch the movie and see homosexual and
crossing-dressing references in it was beyond surprising. Gaston had an
uncomfortable moment when his companion hugged him rather
inappropriately and he mentioned that he is single because he is clingy
as he stares at Gaston admirably. During the battle at the
castle...there where 3 men that was wrapped in women&#x27;s clothing by the
wardrobe - 2 ran embarrassed, but one remained and posed in delight and
then pranced down the stairs with the wardrobe cheering him on. I&#x27;m
just saying..those moments were disappointing. I don&#x27;t think Walt
Disney would have been pleased.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty  and  the  Beast<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast continues Disney&#x27;s very profitable line of fairy
tales made in live action (after Alice in Wonderland -2010-,
Maleficient, Cinderella and The Jungle Book -2016-). And even though
Beauty and the Beast is a lavish production with an amazing design and
excellent special effects, it didn&#x27;t leave me completely satisfied.
However, that doesn&#x27;t mean this is a bad film by any means; on the
opposite, Beauty and the Beast offers abundant visual delight, and,
despite its redundant and inflated screenplay, it keeps enough elements
of the original tale in order to please the fans and capture the
imagination of new generations, supported by the sober direction from
Bill Condon, who knows how to keep the romance above the visual
spectacle. In the role of Belle, I honestly found Emma Watson a bit
rigid and unable to release the total strength of her character&#x27;s
emotions; in other words, she always feels repressed and a bit cold.
Dan Stevens brings a competent performance as the Beast, even though
he&#x27;s occasionally sabotaged by the limitations of the digital
character; the studio Digital Domain created a Beast with an impressive
organic realism, but the dead look occasionally ruins the illusion and
reminds us of his artificial origin. Regarding the rest of the human
cast, I liked the performances from Luke Evans, Kevin Kline and Josh
Gad; and finally, we have the solid voice performances from Ewan
McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Ian McKellen, Audra McDonald, Gugu Mbatha-Raw
and Emma Thompson. On the negative side, Beauty and the Beast feels
longer than it should, introducing sub- plots which don&#x27;t substantially
contribute to the story, even though they allow the presence of more
visual flourish; and the third act full of action feels a bit dissonant
with the languid rhythm of the rest of the movie, but at least, it
leads to a good ending. In conclusion, I didn&#x27;t find Beauty and the
Beast particularly memorable, but it kept me entertained, and I liked
it more than other live action adaptations of fairy tales.

This is the 7th film version of Beauty and The Beast and I really
wonder why they made another, especially seeing it&#x27;s part human and
part animation but it works . It&#x27;s neither a film version of the
Broadway stage hit or a Human version of the great fully animated
Disney feature film. It does have all the magic and effects that Disney
dollars can throw at a film and a few new songs and plot twists.The cast is very capable especially Emma Watson, who sings well and
looks suitably enchanting as a true Disney Princess should . It&#x27;s was
fun to see some favourites of mine like Audra McDonald as Madame
Garderobes and Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts . The new songs by Alan
Menken don&#x27;t really add anything to his original score in fact I think
they made a mistake by not including Human Again in this film it&#x27;s a
great production number and I missed it, perhaps it&#x27;s on the DVD extras
cost certainly couldn&#x27;t have been a factor in dropping it with Disney
dollars behind it.In conclusion it&#x27;s a good film with reservations I prefer the 1946 Jean
Cocteau version, watched it recently with new Phillip Glass opera
soundtrack or The fully human live Broadway musical production, but yes
it&#x27;s lovely and pays little tributes to The Sound of Music opening
scene Maria twirling while &#x22;The Hills are Alive &#x22;and little references
to the Original Cocteau version but please no more Beauty and The
Beasts , that&#x27;s enough!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Pretty but lifeless retelling<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
There is a trend going on right now with Disney films, that they are
redoing their animated classics in live-action &#x96; Alice In Wonderland,
Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and now the latest in this
trend Beauty And The Beast. This one was going to be difficult for me
because the 1991 Disney film Beauty And The Beast is one of my
favourite films of all time.So how do I feel this film? Honestly I spent the first half being
pretty annoyed as it was just carbon copy with minor changes, but I
just accepted it by the time I got to the second half and just
pretended I was watching a play of the movie instead. But then I have
to admit there was one really great scene that got me emotional towards
the end. Not enough to make me love the film, in a way it highlights my
biggest problem with the film, I&#x27;ll get to it later and don&#x27;t worry I
won&#x27;t spoil it.The majority of it is pretty much a copy of the 1991 film, they might
as well have used the same storyboards. The problem though is not so
much that it redoes the same scenes, it&#x27;s that they get lost in
translation, not enough effort is put in to create the same feelings. I
lost count over how many cut-to-blacks this film has.Visually this film is really nice to look at. Many of the sets are well
designed, the castle especially with all the little details. However
the environments of the locations aren&#x27;t well explored that you notice
at times that it&#x27;s shot on a sound stage. The CGI effects for the Beast
is not that great, I don&#x27;t understand why they couldn&#x27;t use
prosthetics, you could&#x27;ve saved legendary make-up artist Rick Baker
from his early retirement. The best CGI goes to the animate objects,
sure the designs were pretty creepy this time but I did buy them as
genuine moving objects &#x96; the mechanics on the clocks look realistic and
the teapot and cup look like real china. Be Our Guest was a visually
stunning moment.The acting all-round was more or less on the same level, they are great
actors but the issue I have is that I&#x27;m always aware that they are
playing the parts. I don&#x27;t see Belle in this film, I just see Emma
Watson playing Belle in this film and it&#x27;s like that for everyone. It
seems like all these big named actors were putting on performances for
theatre instead of an actual film. It&#x27;s kind of bad that I think the
characters in an animated film feel more like real people than the ones
played by real people. I don&#x27;t care how much they expand on their
backstories or how many additional character-building moments they are
given; if they don&#x27;t act natural I&#x27;m not going to be invested in them.
They&#x27;re never boring however, you can tell everyone had a lot of fun
making this, so at times they share that enjoyment with you. The
strongest performances are from Kevin Kline as Maurice and Josh Gad as
Le Fou, I guess that helps that their characters are the most different
from their animated counterparts, they&#x27;re less goofy and are a little
more realistic. The singing is not the greatest either, not Russell
Crowe or Peirce Brosnan levels of bad, but not good compared to the
singing in the original. The best singing comes from Audra McDonald,
whom is a soprano but she&#x27;s not given enough to sing.In terms of what this added (again not to spoil the film), there are
about four new songs added which were good I will admit, I could see
these fitting into theatre productions quite well. There are some
really good additional scenes like when Maurice and Belle work on a
music box together and they mention her mother and a pretty unpleasant
scene with Gaston and Maurice. There&#x27;s a scene that could&#x27;ve taken this
film in a unique direction, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere and
adds nothing except to try and expand on Belle&#x27;s past which kind of
ruins the subtle moment she had with her father at the beginning. Then
there is the big scene towards the end that made me tear up, it was a
real heart-breaking scene. It was built up quite well and when it
happens it lets it play out. Very clever and by far the best scene they
did in this film. So why is the best scene it&#x27;s biggest problem?
Because it&#x27;s a moment that does not involve Belle or the Beast and it
made me realise I how much didn&#x27;t really care about them here. I love
Belle and the Beast, they are awesome characters because in the
original they are allowed to be characters. They have genuine emotions
that you feel in all of their scenes and you feel their chemistry even
in scenes without dialogue. Here despite being &#x27;more developed&#x27; they
feel still feel shallow, again it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t feel like real
people and their chemistry is non-existent.I apologise that I keep making so many comparisons to the original but
it&#x27;s very difficult not to. This film keeps reminding me of the
original, it keeps redoing it but not as well with minor changes and
additions that aren&#x27;t strong enough to let this film stand on it&#x27;s own
merits. Honestly, this film only works for me as like seeing a stage
theatre version of a film you like. In fact if you watch this film
without seeing the original, you&#x27;d probably think you are watching a
stylised film adaptation of a musical play like 2004&#x27;s Phantom Of The
Opera. If you bare that in mind you&#x27;ll enjoy this just fine, it&#x27;s not
bad by any means but it won&#x27;t stand the test of time. The 1991 movie
however is a timeless classic.

When i was a kid Beauty and the Beast (1991) is one of my most favorite
animated films of all time (followed by Mulan and Toy Story 2) so
there&#x27;s no denying that this review is going to be a little bias.Why is that ? you might asked, it&#x27;s because this Beauty and the Beast
basically try to do exactly what the animated version do like literally
almost copy and pasted frame by frame and this became the most negative
things about this Live Action version even though it adds a few
backstory here and there (which i appreciated) the part where it&#x27;s
exactly the same lacks the emotion or authenticity like 1991 version
did.A lot of iconic scene came out kind a bland because it can&#x27;t go crazy
like the animated film did instead it just move there in a frame called
&#x27;Beauty and the Beast 1991 version&#x27; in a way that there&#x27;s so few room
left to actually breathe (or dare i say they too scared to actually do
something new?), sure production design is so beautiful sometimes even
more than the original but when the emotion is not there at all it&#x27;s
pointless.one thing that i really need to gave credit to is Luke Evans like wow
he&#x27;s really really great as Gaston, honestly he&#x27;s one of the best thing
about this version.If we judge Beauty and the Beast ( 2017 ) by it&#x27;s own without comparing
it to the original movie it&#x27;s a pretty good movie but still i think
that&#x27;s impossible because in the end it&#x27;s a remake, and few of new
backstory is not worth to trade with emotion and authenticity than the
original has.

Some others reviewers are right, like about how the Beast&#x27;s CGI wasn&#x27;t
the best or that Emma Watson was auto-tuned, but they don&#x27;t have to be
so rude about it. (TROLLS. I&#x27;ll bet some of them haven&#x27;t even seen the
movie!) Here&#x27;s my opinion:I was disappointed by this at first, and I agree with some other things
people say--Belle seemed kind of bland and not full of emotion at
points, and I felt out of place at some points, but when ignoring the
bad and looking at the good, it is a beautiful movie. It doesn&#x27;t match
the original, but there were a ton of mistakes fixed, like the prince&#x27;s
age and (HUGE SPOILER) where Mrs. Potts&#x27;s husband was. I didn&#x27;t like
the narrator, and sometimes it was too dark, but it was an excellent
movie to watch. Of course, it is without the touch of the original, but
this gives us a new touch. Here&#x27;s what I think about the acting, songs,
CGI, and so on:Songs and singing: The classic ones were back and some of them
stretched out and with extra dialog, which I didn&#x27;t like, but &#x22;Be Our
Guest&#x22; and &#x22;Gaston&#x22; blew me away. It was strange to see the Beast&#x27;s
lips moving instead of hearing his thoughts and made me feel a bit out
of place, but when he sings the last line of &#x22;Evermore,&#x22; I get
goosebumps. Though the song is a bit strange to watch, it&#x27;s great to
listen to. I liked that &#x22;Something There&#x22; wasn&#x27;t in a few minutes Belle
and the Beast shared, but over several days. You&#x27;d see them in
different parts of the castle doing different things. In some places,
Emma Watson is obviously auto-tuned, but a new song she sings in her
childhood attic was not auto-tuned at all and is a masterpiece to
listen to. It is short but very heart-touching. Aside from the
auto-tuning, Emma Watson&#x27;s voice was better than the original Belle&#x27;s
voice, for the original woman, Paige O&#x27;Hara, was a Broadway singer, and
Broadway singers purposely try to sound like they&#x27;re singing from their
noses. The original Belle was fine to hear talk, but when singing, she
and the cartoon seemed like two separate women. I couldn&#x27;t see how the
voice was Belle&#x27;s; it seemed like a woman&#x27;s voice in a girl&#x27;s body, as
someone else said. Ewan McGregor did an excellent job at &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;
(except for the way he said, &#x22;With my fellow candlesticks,&#x22; which
drives me nuts to listen to), and Luke Evans did an incredible job as
Gaston. I loved the way he stretched, &#x22;And I&#x27;m roughly the size of a
ba-ARGE!&#x22; He sounded better than the original Gaston. Emma Thompson did
a lovely job singing, &#x22;Beauty and the Beast,&#x22; which is a pleasure to
listen to. The songs were much fuller. Acting and characters: Belle often looked bored, tired, or emotionless,
but that&#x27;s because they purposely did a new design of Belle. I kept on
thinking, &#x22;Emma Watson, Emma Watson, Emma Watson,&#x22; but after she came
back to town to rescue her father, I was swept up in the story and
somehow thinking, &#x22;Belle.&#x22; Ewan McGregor&#x27;s fake French accent was NOT
obnoxious. Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts sounded friendly and warm. Josh
Gad was hilarious as LeFou, who had great character improvement, same
with Kevin Kline as Maurice. Luke Evans was perfect for Gaston, and his
eyes were so full of hatred and hunger that I couldn&#x27;t imagine it as
acting.Humor: The humor was wonderful. No dull jokes that fell flat or made me
go, &#x22;Ummm...okay? Was that supposed to be humor?&#x22; Gaston was a fun
villain, and the Beast actually did a bunch of funny things. That
actually made him more lovable and made me more emotional when he was
dying near the end.Action: The battles at the end and wolves were amazing. It was very
exciting to watch and one of the parts of the movie that I want to see
again and again. And though he was a fun villain earlier, what Gaston
did made me hate him.&#x22;Exclusive gay moment&#x22;: That was actually nothing. LeFou makes Gaston
hug him, but there&#x27;s no hint of it otherwise. He accidentally dances
with a man at the end, but if it hadn&#x27;t been on the news, no one would
have noticed that LeFou was &#x22;gay&#x22; for Gaston.Changes: There are more improvements and explanations, like why the
servants became objects when the Beast was the unkind one, how the
Beast became unkind in the first place, and why no one knows about a
castle ten miles away. Belle leaves the castle for her father in her
yellow dress. (Apparently in the original, she had to leave the Beast
to get her father, but she took enough time to change her clothes.) One
great change for me was that the Beast was much more lovable. In the
original, he was a jerk and then solemn, never funny or someone you&#x27;d
want to meet. He was a great character, but I never felt any
connection. Here, he was hilarious and kind, so I was devastated when
he was dying. There were more black characters, too. In the original,
every single character and even extra was white.CGI: Okay. Chip&#x27;s CGI was awesome, and the Beast sometimes moved kind
of strange. The CGI was nothing like live-action Jungle Book, which
blew me away. The wolves looked a bit fake but were the best CGI
besides Chip. Overall: I liked the songs and score better than the original and also
loved all the character improvements and mistakes fixed, but at some
points, it seemed a bit lacking. It was a great movie to watch, and
I&#x27;ll no doubt buy it when it comes out on DVD, but in comparison to the
original, the original wins any day.

This was perhaps the most awaited Disney movie of the year for me,
because freaking Emma Watson is playing Belle! Sigh, one of my most
favourite Disney protagonists, Belle in live action (in English,
because there&#x27;s already a French one done) was going to be a 10/10, but
it wasn&#x27;t really...&#x22;I can&#x27;t go back into my childhood, one that my father made secure.&#x22;
Just one of the most powerful line deliveries in the movie that struck
a chord. The second one being &#x22;I want much more than this provincial
life!&#x22; (I couldn&#x27;t stop lip-syncing to the whole song.Beautiful costumes, but I was disappointed not to see the tour of the
castle with Cogsworth going &#x22;if it ain&#x27;t baroque, don&#x27;t fix it&#x22; because
the resplendent Rococo sets were something I so badly wanted to
discover! I hope we get to see in the Blu-rays deleted scenes or
something. If not, I hope the creators make a virtual reality
app/game/story or something! Disney, make it happen?There were so many times I was flowing with the story line, seeing the
animated Bella flawlessly emoted by Emma. But there were so many times
I just saw Emma Watson, that mega star who is a role model for all
young kids, and I really saw &#x22;UN Women&#x22; flashing in my head. Some
places, she was Belle, some places she was Emma and I&#x27;m still not sure
how to feel about it. I think it&#x27;s super hard for me to see her
anything other than herself because she&#x27;s so powerfully iconic as is
Belle. *sigh* But if I&#x27;m already feeling this was, I guess I feel as
though she was miscast.&#x22;How does a moment last forever&#x22; by Celine Dion and &#x22;Evermore,&#x22; and
&#x22;Days in the sun&#x22; are definitely gonna be played on loop the whole
month and added to my &#x22;Extreme fave playlist&#x22; on iPod.Belle&#x27;s dress. Totes not disappointed, but couldn&#x27;t help but notice
Emma&#x27;s quirky mannerisms and gestures with her hands throughout the
dance. She has a way of making &#x22;swan neck&#x22; arm + paw gestures, which
are very her, so I was distracted by that..Belle&#x27;s lack of &#x22;awe&#x22; to the &#x22;Be our guest&#x22; song and many other
scenes.. I can only describe it as a mildly amused reactions... In a
lot of the scenes in fact, they were not emoted to its full potential,
and I was left feeling &#x22;WHY ISN&#x27;T SHE FEELING WHAT I&#x27;M FEELING!&#x22; Like I
said, I feel she was miscast. She wasn&#x27;t as lively as Belle was...Also, Belle and Dan&#x27;s chemistry was nothing compared to Belle and
Beast&#x27;s chemistry. That &#x22;became human again&#x22; and dance scene post that
was super bland... And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who feels this
way..Dull directing, not half as grand and cinematic as it could have been.
But then again, he was the Twilight director so...I hope Aladin doesn&#x27;t disappoint.

Before we get down to business it&#x27;s only right that I admit to never
having seen the beloved Beauty and the Beast Disney animation from
1991, a film that clearly holds a special spot in people&#x27;s hearts, as
well as being regarded as one of quintessential telling&#x27;s of the Beauty
and the Beast story.To be even more honest, I&#x27;ve never seen or read an iteration of the
Beauty and the Beast story at all, for whatever reason, so my feelings
leading up towards the release of this modern day retelling of the
famous story were probably quite different to many other&#x27;s and
regardless of how the populace feels about this film as it stands, its
already a huge box office smashing hit that will likely see Disney have
another film enter into the famed billion dollar club in the coming
weeks/months.Now the actual film itself as directed by Dreamgirls helmer Bill Condon
is one that will likely appease hard-core fans and newbies alike thanks
to its sumptuous production design and often visually captivating
settings but for a story that&#x27;s seemingly remained as popular as ever
over a number of years, no doubt through its emotionally charged and
magical story, this lavishly produced music filled romantic fantasy is
a rather cold experience when it comes down to the nitty gritty of love
against the odds story at its core.In the biggest test of her career yet, Hogwarts graduate Emma Watson
has the relatively daunting task of bringing screen heroine Belle back
to the big time in a performance filled with singing, impressive
costume changes and the requirement to act alongside CGI tea-cups and
the at the time non-furry beast and she makes a good fist of it without
ever really becoming a standout. It shows the still learning actress is
capable of carrying a film but it&#x27;s unlikely her turn will be regarded
as a new Disney staple in the female heroine stakes.Arguably with the tougher job, still relatively unknown Dan Stevens
does a fine job of becoming the Beast, under the disguise of some
noteworthy CGI work (the Beast often looks almost photo real in the
right circumstances) he performs well but a major problem Condon&#x27;s film
has is within its chemistry between the two leads and while
individually they&#x27;re fine, as an on screen budding romance there&#x27;s no
real fire, merely a flicker and no amount of visual pizazz was ever
going to carry the film past a certain point if this was to be the
case.There&#x27;s able support from co-stars like Luke Evan&#x27;s as the despicable
Gaston and Kevin Kline as Belle&#x27;s father Maurice while a couple of the
A-list voice stars such as Ewan McGregor and Emma Thompson try their
best to make the various household objects cursed alongside the Beast
work, but at times McGregor in particular seems to be trying a little
too hard to be French while Thompson&#x27;s &#x22;poppet&#x22; filled script work
grates after a while.The other somewhat lacking component of this updated Beast is the fact
that for a musical, a lot of the big singing set pieces never truly
fly. Perhaps spoilt from recent musical masterpiece La La Land the big
song and dance numbers within Condon&#x27;s film are more tolerable than
toe-tappingly exciting and bar a nice opening number as Belle sings her
way through her local village, the rest of the films well liked and no
doubt well known songs do seem to lack that certain magical touch that
would&#x27;ve made this well-meaning experience fly rather than simply amble
along.This Beauty and the Beast is without doubt a beauty but in the grand
scheme of things this box office behemoth is but a pleasant experience
without ever threatening to be a great one and while this entertaining
popcorn event will be a popular date night pick and a new favourite for
little wannabe Disney princesses everywhere, it&#x27;s unlikely this
re-telling of the ever popular source material will ever be regarded as
fondly as its hairy forefathers.3 &#x22;papa&#x27;s&#x22; out of 5
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The look and production of Beauty and the Beast lets everyone be their guest, but this tale as old as time is better animated<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When I was helping my parents move a couple of years ago, I came across
a bunch of old photos, including an old Halloween picture of me dressed
as Lumi&#xE8;re when I was five. Yes, Beauty and the Beast was that
wonderful animated movie that everyone has pretty much seen. It&#x27;s my
all time favorite of the traditional fairy tale stories from Disney,
and for good reason. The characters are perfect, the animation is
perfect, the songs are perfect, and the story is perfect. It was also
the first animated movie to receive a best picture nomination at the
Oscars and has a long running Broadway show.It remains one of Disney&#x27;s most popular and profitable movies of all
time, so it made sense that they would want to return to it. Given how
Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book live action remakes have
done incredibly well, it seems that this tale as old as time would be
eyed for that same fate. Whats difficult about adapting this story in
this manner is figuring out what to expand. The other movies had a lot
of areas from their stories to explore into, but how do you expand the
world of Beauty and the Beast? ...let&#x27;s see.Like in the animated movie, a vain prince turns away an ugly old woman
from his castle, despite being warned about inner beauty. When he
dismisses her again, she reveals herself an sorceress and transforms
him into the Beast (played by Dan Stevens) and a curse is placed on the
castle and everyone inside. Cut to twenty years later where a book obsessed young woman Belle
(played by Emma Watson) makes the best of her life within her small
french village. Former army captain and hunter Gaston (played by Luke
Evans) eyes her as a wife, but she wants nothing to do with it. When Belles father Maurice (played by Kevin Kline) ends up locked up in
the castle that he stumbled upon, Belle goes there to get him out.
Though the Beast frightens her, she agrees to take her fathers place.
This makes her a prisoner, but she gets a nice room. Helping them out
is candlestick Lumi&#xE8;re (played by Ewan McGregor), clock Cogsworth
(played by Ian McKellen) and Teapot Mrs. Potts (played by Emma
Thompson). A romance seems to bloom for Belle and the Beast, but Gaston
and help from his friend Lefou (played by Josh Gad) are trying to stop
it. It&#x27;s amazing just how close this movie follows the original Beauty and
the Beast. Unfortunately, it follows it way too close. While it&#x27;s not
completely shot-for-shot (like the Psycho remake), there are plenty of
moments when it feels like the idea was to take many of the famous
images from the animated movie and do it again. I guess I can say
what&#x27;s different is the look. A lot of that has to do with the fact
that it&#x27;s live action, but the production value is gorgeous. I&#x27;ll bet a
million dollars that this wins a lot of the Oscars next year for
costume, makeup, and production design.How does the cast stack up? They seem to do alright. The best newcomers
are Kevin Kline and Josh Gad as they seemed to be the only ones to
really bring something new to their characters. The rest like Ewan
McGregor, Luke Evans and Ian McKellen do fine, but the worst has to be
the films main character Belle, Emma Watson. Not only is it clear that
they auto tuned her voice for the songs, but she still looks too much
like a girl while I had pictured Belle as a woman (Olivia Wilde would
have been my choice).I&#x27;ll give this five Lumi&#xE8;re candlesticks out of ten. On it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s
okay to sometimes good. I can see a lot of people getting swept up in
the world more then the characters. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ll always be
comparing this to the superior animated movie. I see this as totally
pointless, but my theater clapped at the end, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll make a
lot of people happy at least. Your invited to be the movie&#x27;s guest, but
I&#x27;ll decline the next invitation.

Recently Disney has become fixated on remaking, rebooting, or re-
imaging their older films. This film is the third live action remake of
one of Disney&#x27;s classic animated films. So this is a remake of an
animated adaptation of a french fairy tale (working title). If you
haven&#x27;t seen the classic animated film or just don&#x27;t remember it the
story goes as follows: Lady falls in love with monster. Of course
there&#x27;s underlying theme&#x27;s and messages to take away but that&#x27;s
basically the story. It&#x27;s simple and easy to understand. This is
probably the greatest strength of the animated film. The story isn&#x27;t
over burdened by much else, it&#x27;s just a love story with whimsical
characters and house hold appliances that sing. It&#x27;s in these details where this remake falls short. While it&#x27;s
essentially a shot for shot remake of the original there are a few
things added. And every single thing added to this that didn&#x27;t exist in
the original feel so out of place and overly convoluted that it&#x27;s hard
to take them seriously. There&#x27;s an entire subplot added to this film
where Belle is attempting to find out how her mother died.It only comes up a few times and it&#x27;s not really even written into the
story. We have the original story and, all of a sudden, Belle discovers
that her mom and dad lived in a windmill in Paris. Like, why? Why is
this even included in the story? It doesn&#x27;t add any depth to her or her
father. It basically is just there to say that her dad loves her, which
I think we can all reasonably infer already. There are various other added scenes and all of them feel roughly the
same as this one. They all come from nowhere, add nothing, and then are
completely forgotten about because they serve absolutely no purpose.
This is where remakes become frustrating. On one hand, you want to see
something new but if you go in a completely new direction people
complain. And if you make a shot for shot remake, people complain.There&#x27;s this tiny gray area in between these two extremes where a
remake is almost acceptable. Look at &#x27;The Force Awakens&#x27; for reference.
While that film was essentially just a remake of &#x27;A New Hope&#x27; there
were new characters, a new threat, new environments, and new ideas
being presented. &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; falls just shy of being a shot
for the shot remake by simply adding a new song or two and a few
scenes.It feels like the same movie but with the deleted scenes added in.
That&#x27;s both the biggest flaw and greatest accomplishment of this film.
It&#x27;s obnoxious to watch a worse version of the same movie but where
this movie works best is in the scenes that are pulled straight from
the cartoon. Seeing this massive budget bring to life the jaw- dropping
castle and characters was really neat.As much as I dislike Disney movies they do know how to utilize a
budget. The sets, costumes, makeup, and CG all look spectacular. There
were many scenes where I was left in awe of how good this movie looked
and how much effort was seemingly put into making it look that good.
And this is where all my respect for the film goes. They did an
absolutely brilliant job bringing the cartoon to life. But that&#x27;s, unfortunately, all this film is good for. It doesn&#x27;t have
an identity of its own. It wants to be the original but also wants to
be its own thing and ends up being neither. There are some beautiful
sets, costumes, and inspired recreations of the classics songs yet the
film falters in nearly every other way. Its story is clouded by
illogical and overly convoluted subplots that just sort of dead end and
add nothing. While I am still strongly against remaking classic films,
I can say that out of the three live action cartoon remakes we have
gotten this is the best, but not by much. Just, make new things,
please.

When the animated Beauty &#x26; the Bast premiered in the early 1990s, that
was the peak of animation at that time. One could say the same about
this new effort as well, for how it seamlessly blends the animation
with its perfect casting to make a beautiful film on a number of
different levels.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story that you are
accustomed to hearing. Belle (Emma Watson) is a bookworm living in a
small, &#x22;boring&#x22; village, with an eccentric father (Kevin Kline) and a
macho arrogant court-er, Garcon (Luke Evans), making her life
difficult. When her father gets lost on a trip back from the market one
night, however, he stumbles upon a castle inhabited by a ferocious
Beast (Dan Stevens), who once was a prince but now cursed into an
animal until he can know true love (explained in the film&#x27;s preamble).
The ever-doting Belle sets out to retrieve her father, also finds the
castle, and the rest is history.First off, I thought this film did a wonderful job of portraying the
basic story that we all know and love. It doesn&#x27;t mess with too many
plot elements, and even adds in a few new wrinkles (always needed to
keep a reboot fresh). The film&#x27;s plot stands the test of time alone, so
in this case I&#x27;m glad that Disney didn&#x27;t try to make too many sweeping
changes.Of course, the success/failure of any B&#x26;B film is going to come down to
the casting of Belle, and Watson is absolutely born to play the role.
We&#x27;re talking once-in-a-lifetime casting here, as there is even synergy
between her real life persona and Belle. She is smart/headstrong enough
to portray Belle, while also beautiful enough to be a true Disney
princess in the golden robe.All the fun auxiliary roles are fun too, what with Cogsworth (Ian
McKellen), Lumiere (Ewen McGregor), Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson), and
Chip (Nathan Mack), among others, livening up the procedures when
necessary. No drop-off from the original here.About the only thing that didn&#x27;t work for me in the film? Josh Gad&#x27;s
LeFou. Annoying &#x22;gay character&#x22; controversy aside, I just felt like his
performance was a bit creepy and forced. I think I would have preferred
him to be in awe of Gaston rather than in love with him.Finally, as I alluded to in the opening, it is amazing how seamless the
interaction of reality and digitization meld together here. In years
past, certain characters would have &#x22;looked fake&#x22; or it would have had
to be fully animated to level the playing field. Not here. Much like
&#x22;The Jungle Book&#x22; live-action remake before it, B&#x26;B is extremely
impressive on the eyes.Overall, I thought that &#x22;Beauty &#x26; the Beast&#x22; was a great take on the
old classic. The casting was nearly perfect, the story remained
basically intact, and for perhaps the first time in the tale&#x27;s visual
portrayals the meld between human/animal characters dwindles to almost
nothing. It may not reinvent the wheel in obvious character or story
ways, but the subtle things go a long way in making it a great overall
experience that the entire family can enjoy.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Live Version Falls Well Short of the Animated Classic!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The animated version of Beauty &#x26; the Beast is my favorite Disney film
of all time. Frankly, I was excited to hear about the live action
version, and I was anxious to see it. Unfortunately, this live action
version is a pale, paltry comparison to its animated predecessor. In
fact, it&#x27;s not really even that close.Those who have seen the original will find very few surprises here
aside from a few minor changes here and there. First of all, Emma Watson just doesn&#x27;t have it in her to play Belle.
Belle is a young woman who is a dreamer, but she is also full of life.
Watson portrays Belle as a girl with a mild interest in, well,
anything! She seldom smiles, and she almost looks bored. Also, Watson
isn&#x27;t incapable of singing, she just isn&#x27;t great. With a sea of
actresses out there who can act AND sing, how hard would it have been
to cast someone who can do both? Disney was obviously banking on
Watson&#x27;s popularity to put people in the seats. They made a mistake.
Everyone knows that if your product is good enough, people will show
up.The Beast, in many ways, is even worse. The CGI people forgot to give
Beast any emotional expression. He growls and sneers a few times, but
mostly, he has a disinterested look about him. It&#x27;s really sad that
both Watson and Stevens/CGI were unable to tap into what makes these
iconic characters so likable and easy to relate to. They also have
virtually no romantic chemistry whatsoever. So, when the epic climax
comes when Belle confesses her feelings, Watson conveys it as if she&#x27;s
simply reading it without any emotional feelings at all. The special effects are impressive, but as with so many films today,
special effects without compelling characters pretty much means that
your film is going to be very shallow. This is just another reason why
the film is flat, as many other reviewers have pointed out.One of the bright spots is Luke Evans&#x27; Gaston. I almost wish that there
had been more of him. Evans can act AND sing! At least someone in this
film is able to do both aside from Evans and Ewan McGregor. Kevin
Kline, a veteran of the stage, is also solid as Belle&#x27;s father, Maurice
as well as Ian McKellan&#x27;s Cogsworth. The songs are all intact, and frankly, the best one is Ewan McGregor
singing &#x22;Be Our Guest.&#x22; Emma Watson&#x27;s contributions are just way too
amateurish and lack any kind of range. All in all, Beauty and the Beast was a disappointment, especially given
the level of expectations and also knowing what Disney is capable of.
Disney fails in this attempt. I really hope they put more effort into
Aladdin than they did this one, or the epic trilogy of Beauty and the
Beast, Aladdin, and Lion King are going to end up being a trilogy of
emptiness and failure.

TL;DR version: This is probably going to be one of my most conflicted
reviews I&#x27;ve ever written. On the one hand, I get to talk trash about
another live action remake from Disney. On the other hand, it also has
a lot of things going for it that I could even consider it to be a huge
improvement to the disaster that was Cinderella (2015). Please keep in
mind this is also after some time of recollecting the film and
comparisons to the 1991 animated version, so take this review with a
grain of salt.With that in mind, let&#x27;s get on with it.This movie does not exactly do the original justice by any stretch of
the word. Many parts of it unfortunately felt as if it was more of a
hollow shell of what it could&#x27;ve potentially been, and that&#x27;s probably
the worst thing going for it. Well, there a three parts to why it does
not stand to the original, and one of which might not affect your
viewing pleasure, or displeasure.One major problem was mostly in regards of how it tries to lengthen the
story and how it also somehow drains it of what made it so good in the
first place. It&#x27;s pretty much a word for word, copy-pasted version of
the animated movie, just with extra bits and songs added in to lengthen
it&#x27;s runtime. In many cases, it didn&#x27;t really work out, and it gave me
some flashbacks of Cinderella (2015). Songs that were added in this
case were executed poorly to the point where it felt as if they were
added in mere days before release. There was, however, a good use of
added time where it did seem to work in a shocking emotional gut punch,
but it&#x27;s small compared to the unfortunately lacking remainder of the
story it leads to.Another problem, which was actually a variable, was the use of 3D.
Seeing this in an IMAX theatre, 3D glasses and all with everything
going on, it is enough to make you nauseas. Whether it was the scene
involving a snowball(which, spoiler alert, was the only reason it was
probably released for 3D, no joke), or just how most of the film was
just moving all over the place in speed, that might make give you a
small migraine at best, and close to getting you sick Worst Case
Scenario. this is only with the 3D version, so if you were to go to the
movie, I would probably recommend seeing it in 2D.The third and probably the worst problem going for it was the look of
it. It&#x27;s a beautiful looking movie, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it&#x27;s still
chuck full of some of the worst looking, uncanny kinds of CGI I had
seen. It tries to make these figures as realistic as possible and have
them look somewhat human as well. In some cases, it looks OK, like with
Lumierre, and maybe Cogsworth. In others, it was downright scary to the
point where i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to young children.(Chip STILL
creeps me the heck out!) Outside of CGI, the Beast&#x27;s look was pretty
underwhelming as well. Rather than a menacing monster, it looks more
like a guy in a furry body suit. It&#x27;s impressive, and props to the
designers for making him look as real as he could, but all I see is
more of a thin, brown version of Asgore Dreemurr from Undertale rather
than the Beast as most would probably recognize.It&#x27;s sad. At first, I really thought this was going to be a good film,
which it still can be at many times. Characters are pretty much the
same from the original, and it dosen&#x27;t bastardize Belle like the other
Live Action movie did so with Cinderella, and it actually made her a
bit more dynamic here. Gaston is still the braggart, womanizing hunter,
if a little toned down, and the Beast is also still the kind of
broken-hearted monster that learns to love. All of it is still there.
However, when stacked up to the original, I honestly can&#x27;t see any real
contest. It has good moments, and it has terrible ones, but overall
it&#x27;s more of a sad, underwhelming film that had great potential. C-Ranking, 2.5/5 Stars.

&#x27;BEAUTY AND THE BEAST&#x27;: Four Stars (Out of Five)Disney&#x27;s live-action remake of their 1991 hit animated musical, of the
same name; which was based on the eighteenth-century fairy tale, also
of the same name, by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. The film tells
the classic story of a woman who falls in love with the beast that
imprisons her, in an enchanted French castle. It stars Emma Watson, Dan
Stevens (of 2014&#x27;s &#x27;THE GUEST&#x27; fame), Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Kevin
Kline, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Gugu
Mbatha-Raw and others. It was directed by Bill Condon (who also helmed
&#x27;THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 1&#x27; and &#x27;2&#x27;, as well as the
musical &#x27;DREAMGIRLS&#x27;), and it was scripted by Evan Spiliotopoulos and
Stephen Chbosky (who also wrote and directed &#x27;THE PERKS OF BEING A
WALLFLOWER&#x27;, also costarring Emma Watson). The film has been a huge hit
at the Box Office so far, and it&#x27;s also gotten mostly positive reviews
from critics. I mostly enjoyed it as well.Belle (Watson) lives in the village of Villeneuve, with her father
Maurice (Kline). She is harassed constantly by a popular, and extremely
arrogant, former soldier named Gaston (Evans); who desperately wants to
marry her. One day, on a trip to the market, Maurice gets lost in the
woods and stumbles upon an old castle. He&#x27;s then attacked, and
imprisoned there, by a beast that lives in the castle (Stevens), for
stealing a rose from the garden. When Maurice&#x27;s horse rushes to Belle
for help, she returns with it to the castle and offers to take her
father&#x27;s place, in order to free him. The Beast accepts her offer,
against Maurice&#x27;s wishes, and Maurice is set free. Belle slowly begins
to sympathize with her captor, as she learns how he, and his staff,
were transformed into a monster, and a bunch of inanimate objects, by a
powerful enchantress. She also later learns, that only true love can
break their curse.The 1991 animated film is one of my favorite Disney animated movies
(excluding Pixar), I remember fondly when it was shockingly nominated
for Best Picture (at the Academy Awards for that year). I haven&#x27;t seen
it in a while, so I don&#x27;t remember for sure how faithful this
live-action remake is, but it seems pretty faithful to me (there&#x27;s a
few things I noticed that were probably changed though). One of the
most notable changes, to the original animated film, is the
controversial inclusion of an openly gay character (played by Josh Gad
in the movie). I think his character definitely makes the film more
entertaining (and Gad is great in the role). I definitely can&#x27;t say I
enjoyed this new version as much as I remember liking the Disney
animated classic, but it is a pretty entertaining and well made update.Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:

This romance failed at being romantic. Weak dialogue, too much focus on
distractingly massive musical production numbers, a lack of chemistry
between Belle and her CGI construct Beast, and a frantic pace created
in editing, all contributed to a lack of affection or sense of
connection to the characters or their relationship.The film is absolutely lovely to look at, but for me it was almost
unbearable to watch. The verbal exchanges often made me cringe when
they weren&#x27;t annoyingly banal. I think the script was dumbed-down to
what the producers hoped would be comprehensible to a very preteen
audience. But I suspect that all most children will notice is the
spectacle and some clever CGI animated characters. Even a teenager
probably won&#x27;t perceive any romance in the film.As for the music, it is of course, familiar...unfortunately. BECAUSE I
am familiar with the brilliant performances in the original, animated
version of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast,&#x22; I had that superior soundtrack to
compare with this version. Emma Watson&#x27;s vocals are credible, although
they were often noticeably auto-tuned. And I would not expect to hear
her performing in any animated production where the singing could be
done by a superior voice. All the other numbers were at the level of a
middling live theater cast with nothing standing out. Even the title
song failed in it&#x27;s role as a &#x22;show-stopper.&#x22;All in all, this live-action &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is the most
disappointing, unsatisfying Disney film this Disney fanatic has every
watched.

WHAT&#x27;S BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ABOUT?Disney updates their 1991 animated classic about a bookish beauty who
falls for a monstrous beast.IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: B+)It won&#x27;t be nominated for Best Picture like the original, but what this
new Beauty and the Beast does right makes up for its flaws. Lets get
the latter out of the way. Emma Watson struggles a bit out of the gate;
she seems to have a decent voice, but director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls)
is unwilling for us to hear any flaws and she&#x27;s noticeably auto- tuned.
Watson shines in subtler, more intimate moments of kindness and
affection, so she&#x27;s great whenever she&#x27;s interacting with her father,
falling for Beast, or bonding with the castle furniture/servants. She&#x27;s
no Julie Andrews, however, and her solo musical monologing leaves
something to be desired.The film also sticks a little too closely to the 1991 film, fearful to
establish itself as something unique as did 2015&#x27;s fantastic
Cinderella. Swaths of dialogue and musical cues are lifted wholesale
and this version can only suffer in comparison to a bona fide classic. What works? Almost everything else. Like I said, Watson does fine work
in many parts of the film. Even though this movie copies the original
in many respects, it usually does a decent job of it. I found myself
most enchanted, however whenever it went &#x22;off book&#x22; and did something
new, such as integrating less-familiar songs from the stage musical,
offering some gorgeous brand-new tracks, patching up plot holes, and
providing well-conceptualized backstories to both Belle and Beast that
effectively deepen their bond and develop them as characters. The cast is excellent. Dan Steven&#x27;s Beast is magnetic; while the
motion-capture animation is occasionally less-than convincing, the
performance is nearly flawless and rich with emotion. Kevin Kline&#x27;s
Maurice is less of a crackpot and more of a steady, loving father here;
his relationship with Belle is very moving. Luke Evans proves an
inspired choice for Gaston; not burly and moronic like his animated
counterpart, here he&#x27;s more of an intelligent narcissist trying to keep
his darker nature in check, making his ultimate failure all the more
chilling.Josh Gad&#x27;s LaFou is much more sympathetic here than he was in the 1991
film, loyal to Gaston but nagged by an ever-growing conscience. The
castle servants were a highlight for me; when you have actors like Emma
Thompson, Ian McKellin, Ewan McGregor, Audra McDonald, and Stanley
Tucci you really can&#x27;t go wrong.Visually the film is a wonder. The music is generally fantastic. This
new film is sure to delight fans of the story and win over a new
generation. I&#x27;d not be surprised if repeat viewings cause me to warm to
it even more. It only suffers in direct comparison to the original, but
as a standalone it satisfies. IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS?Beauty and the Beast is rated PG. There are some intense and
frightening moments in which wolves menace various people and attack
Beast. Speaking of the titular love monster, he is frightening and
intimidating in several scenes. A man punches another man unconscious
and leaves him for dead. A character is shown to be dying of disease.
Beast is shot by Gaston several times and hit in the head with a stone
fixture. Characters drink alcohol in a tavern. Before being turned into
Beast, the prince is shown leering over several maidens at a dance. As
for the so-called &#x22;gay controversy,&#x22; it&#x27;s much ado about nothing. LaFou
is portrayed as effeminate. The opera singer chest of drawers attacks
three men, dressing them in women&#x27;s clothing; two are mortified, one
comically enjoys it. Later, while rotating dancing partners LaFou bumps
into that man (who&#x27;s no longer dressed as a woman) and they smile at
each other. That&#x27;s it. ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGESOnly through accountability, humility, and contrition can we change our
natures. Do not judge based on outward appearance; rather, consider a
person&#x27;s character. It&#x27;s never too late to do the right thing.

The scenery is beautiful and there are some really nice moments, so it
is worth a watch. However as someone how loves the original I had a few issues with it,
which really distracted me from the story: 1)The most interesting
character in the whole story is Gaston, he is fun and good looking and
plays the character so well you simply can&#x27;t hate him!! I feel he
really saved this movie for me, other wise it would have been 3 stars
but he is meant to be the baddie! 2)Yes Emma is beautiful and does look
like I would imagine Belle, however her signing sounded really strained
and unnatural and made me wish it would stop. 3) Mrs. Potts,
Chip,Lumiere and Cogsworth - what happened to you!!! In the cartoon
they are so charming now they just look odd, border line creepy.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just OK, but a bit slow<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The story of the movie is fine, but it becomes too slow because it has
too much many songs. For those who like musicals it&#x27;s great, but in my
opinion, it&#x27;s a bit slow. I really liked some of the actors working on
this film and the script is also good. Regarding the age rating, as
indicated the film is recommended for all audiences, especially for
children.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A stunning masterpiece<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
There are almost no words for how amazing this movie was, but I am
going to try my best anyway! If you are a true fan of the original
film, there is no possible way you will not adore this movie. It brings
wonderful additions and insights to the original story and the entire
film is really just a feast for the eyes. The music will fully engulf
you and make you feel like you are there with the characters.Emma Watson is visually the perfect Belle and portrays the part
beautifully. Her singing is of course not as good as Paige O&#x27;Hara but I
really didn&#x27;t feel like her lesser voice mattered much in the film.
They definitely needed to lower some of the keys and change some of the
notes in order for Emma Watson to perform some parts of the songs but
you could tell that she worked really hard to train her voice as best
as she could and it resulted in a very pleasant sound.Luke Evans is great as Gaston, though I do not feel that any actual
human man could play Gaston perfectly. Gaston is a huge, hulking man
and refers to himself as a specimen. In the original, he is able to
throw Lefou around like a pillow and he lifts the blond triplets and
the bench with one arm with ease. He has a deep, booming voice and he
is &#x22;roughly the size of a barge.&#x22; Does any actual actor come to mind
with any of those phrases? Luke Evans definitely had Gaston&#x27;s
narcissism, rudeness and viciousness down. But I personally did not
feel like he was unbelievably handsome, big or brawny. But I was still
very pleased with his performance.Josh Gad absolutely stole the show from Gaston as Lefou. He added depth
to the character who was really just comic relief in the original
cartoon. He sung &#x22;Gaston&#x22; in the tavern perfectly, it was really like
the animation was just transferred to real life. I hope he gets the
credit he deserves for that role. Certainly blows Olaf from Frozen
right out of the water! Kevin Kline was a surprisingly wonderful
Maurice and I really felt the love between he and Belle. I loved the
additions they made with her mother and why Belle was so enchanted by
roses to begin with. I&#x27;m glad they made Maurice more serious in this
version, he was very goofy in the cartoon.Dan Stevens was wonderful as the beast and they added a surprising
amount of humor to his lines. I at first didn&#x27;t like that he knew how
to read but I suppose it never made sense in the original that a prince
didn&#x27;t know how to read. My favorite song was the one he sung when
Belle leaves, that was breathtaking. I thought he was the perfect
handsome prince too, especially his eyes.There were a few additions I did not care for but I did not feel should
take away from the rating. I wish Gaston had died the way he did in the
cartoon, right in front of Belle who chooses to save the beast and does
not even give Gaston a second glance as he plummets to his death. I
also wish that the enchantress was NOT present during the beast&#x27;s
transformation back into the prince. I found that unnecessary and
intrusive, that was supposed to be Belle and the Prince&#x27;s moment. I
also found it very strange and annoying that they did not speak to each
other at all, they just stared at each other and then kissed. I
preferred the original there, but these are just my preferences.I also felt like the servants gave away WAY too much to Belle in this
version. It was almost shocking that Belle wasn&#x27;t able to figure out
what was going on herself with all of the info they let slip. All the
little characters were wonderful, particularly the wardrobe.Overall, it is a truly breathtaking movie, one that only comes along
once in a blue moon. You will be amazed how they literally transferred
some parts of the cartoon directly into live action. They used the same
music, same background noises, dialogue, EVERYTHING...for the most
part.Don&#x27;t miss out on this. You should really just drop whatever it is you
are doing and go see this move now! Outstanding!

From the moment I&#x27;ve heard that they will be making live version of
Disney&#x27;s 1991 &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; movie, I was beyond excited, and
when the first teaser trailer came out I almost started crying because
it seemed so promising and made me shiver and nostalgic. Then other
trailers started coming out - it still looked promising. Then, I heard
Emma singing and that&#x27;s when I became doubtful. I really hated the way
she sang, it seemed so robotic and not even close to the original. But
OK, I still decided to give movie a chance. But unfortunately,my
suspicions were confirmed - I left the theater slightly disappointed.
Whole movie seemed so forced and unnatural, and, like someone already
said - Emma keeps playing the same role in all movies, her facial
expressions are not much different from Harry Potter and other roles
she played. Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts...they were all kind of
creepy (especially Mrs. Potts and Chip) and unconvincing. The only two
characters that were actually very well played are those of LeFou and
Gaston.As for the songs, they were actually OK most of the time, considering
that some of them were &#x22;destroyed&#x22; for me, like &#x27;Be our guest&#x27; - how
could they mess up with that song?? And as for Emma&#x27;s singing, it
didn&#x27;t sound THAT bad when you actually watch the film, but still -
Paige O&#x27;Hara is unbeatable (sorry Emma), and they added some new songs,
of which I really liked Evermore. About transformation scene, it was SO MUCH BETTER in the original, it
just seemed to happen so fast and with lack of emotions (considering
the fact that this scene was my favorite in the 1991 original and
always brought tears to my eyes, I could say that in this movie it was
slightly destroyed for me). I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s THAT bad, but could
they make it much better? Definitely yes. And about love story between
Belle and Beast, it was not convincing at all. In the original you
could at least see how romantic story between them is developing, in
here - not so much. And about library scene - completely destroyed. In
the original you could feel (not just see, but feel) how Belle felt
first time she saw the library, and in this version not at all.I could go all day like this, but I won&#x27;t. I made my point and I hope I
helped you with my review. :)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The First Disney Remake to Feel Mostly Pointless<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney&#x27;s latest money-printer&#x85;I mean live-action remake&#x85;has most
everything we all love about the 1992 animated opus: the magical
romance, the fun characters, the beautiful art direction, and possibly
the greatest collection of songs in Disney&#x27;s impressive canon. And
based on the first weekend box office, audiences are more than happy to
be guests in this world again. The problem for me is that everything
they love here, they love, or would love, in the much superior
original. Instead of taking a new approach to their property (i.e.
Cinderella, Jungle Book), Beauty and the Beast is essentially a
moment-for-moment remake with some hit-and-miss additions. So you
already know the story: girl is imprisoned by beast, beast learns to
love, girl returns love, etc. A couple of backstory facelifts and
plot-hole fixes are really the only changes in this update, and they do
serve their purpose. Even the romance itself is given a needed
expansion, making their love slightly more genuine. However, those
additions also further other pressing questions (why did she stay
imprisoned for so long?). Also, the titular characters are just plain
worse. The normally competent and likable Watson is completely out of
her element, opting for a quieter and frankly smugger Belle than the
quirky and free-spirited one, and the beast roars uncanny valley like a
furry Transformer. On the plus side, the household objects (Lumiere,
Cogsworth, etc) have a much better arc, including more than a few funny
moments and a surprisingly emotional plight. The question is: are these
additions enough to warrant a brand-new movie? I guess if you refuse to
revisit the original then they are. Otherwise, they simply aren&#x27;t.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Did I miss the gay stuff?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beastiality is a tough movie to watch as a cartoon, it&#x27;s
even more disturbing as a live action film. first off, the story is
about abuse and allowing a person to imprison you and abuse you with
the hope that there is a better person underneath it all and falling in
love with this person. seeing this Stockholm Syndrome story played out
in live action may be a little tougher for some viewers. but the part i
couldn&#x27;t get passed is the fact that this dude probably stunk because
his fur would get all wet out in the snow. dogs stink when they come in
from the snow, imagine a dog that big. it appears to be a period before
sanitation, so where and how does he poop and pee? that beast has sharp
teeth and is breathing all over that girl. his breath probably was all
stank. Plus, giving oral would not be pleasurable for a woman. Unless
he licks like a dog, then that might be pleasurable. Not to mention an
erection. What would that be like? Is like a bull penis or is it more
like the dog lipstick?then, SPOILER ALERT for those of you who don&#x27;t know the ending of a 300
year old story, after the beast becomes a man (a man who probably looks
better as a walking buffalo), the girl wants him to grow a beard. what
next? bringing animals into the bedroom? also, my wife brought up that
he had hooves and hind legs like a cow, so how does he get up and down
the stairs? The actress, though attractive, didn&#x27;t really have what i
thought would be the Bella look. i know it&#x27;s corny and probably not
expected in this modern world, but perhaps someone like Ariana Grande
would fit better in this roll (plus, she sings). also, where&#x27;s all the
gay $#!+ that everyone was talking about? i waited so long for it, with
my Vaseline and Kleenex and saw nothing. did i miss something? sure,
there was a guy who gets put in a dress and enjoys it, but as my social
brainwashing goes, that does not make one gay. then the two dudes
dancing together. unless they&#x27;re rubbing up on each other, doing the
bump and grind or grabbing each other&#x27;s ass, then i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s
gay. but then again, you&#x27;re watching a musical -- now, that&#x27;s gay.
also, the state of Alabama is said to have a problem with Disney having
a gay character, and the worst of it is two dudes dance together, yet
they have no problem with a woman getting it on with a buffalo. But,
then again, it&#x27;s Alabama.

Director Bill Condon (&#x22;Dreamgirls&#x22; - 2006) knows his way around
real-life big budget films, however, his current special/visual/CGI
effects film is too dark (literally it&#x27;s in shadow throughout much of
the film) to be thoroughly enjoyed by it&#x27;s primary audience - children.
As for the &#x22;gay&#x22; issue, PLEASE! Guys briefly wearing female clothing
and/or a few seconds of two men dancing together does not make a gay
film. To Condon&#x27;s credit, he doesn&#x27;t change the story much, so if
you&#x27;ve seen the animation and the live theatre production (and who
hasn&#x27;t?), there&#x27;s really no need to see this version. Belle (played by
all grown up Emma Watson &#x22;Harry Potter&#x22;) does a nice job, giving her
Belle more of self assured female presences. The Beast (Dan Stevens -
Matthew from &#x22;Downton Abbey) costumes and make-up is terrific, and
Stevens&#x27; managers to display a nice warm conflict in emotions
throughout. On the other hand, Gaston (Luke Evans &#x22;Dracula&#x22; 2014) is
over the top in dialogue and jesters, making his character a Laurel and
Hardy team opposite LeFou (Josh Gad &#x22;Book of Mormon&#x22;). While it&#x27;s
always great to see Kevin Kline on the big screen, his Maurice didn&#x27;t
feel connected to the story, and the &#x22;antique&#x22; VoiceOvers (Ewan
McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Audra McDonald and Stanley
Tucci) were fun in CGI format, when they transformed back to human, it
was all too stagy for my enjoyment. In fact, the big wrap at the end
was really the end for me. Maybe I&#x27;m just tired of film/TV musicals?
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>&#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27;: Another Pointless Remake<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
There&#x27;s really one key question you have to ask yourself when remaking
a classic: how are you making this different than before? how are you
contributing to the mythos of this story? At best, it&#x27;s unwise to
create a remake without an original vision; it will surely suffer when
compared to the original. Remember Gus Van Sant&#x27;s misguided
shot-for-shot remake of &#x22;Psycho&#x22;?2017&#x27;s &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; isn&#x27;t nearly as ill-advised, but it&#x27;s in
the same vain. Disney has been remaking their animated classics into
live action films over the past few years, primarily due to the success
of 2010&#x27;s &#x22;Alice in Wonderland&#x22;. However, with the exception of Jon
Favreau&#x27;s spectacular &#x22;The Jungle Book&#x22;, the whole endeavor has been
grossly underwhelming. Sadly, &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is not an
exception.That&#x27;s not to say the movie is bad per se. It&#x27;s well made with some
incredibly talented actors in the mix (Kevin Kline, Ewan Mcgregor,
Stanley Tucci, Emma Thompson, and Ian Mckellan all in supporting roles)
solidly mixing drama with gentle goofiness. The animation on Beast is
iffy, but in general, the computer effects are well done. The movie is
overlong, but the pacing balances out this issue for the most part.
Honestly, in a vacuum, this would be a very good movie.However, this movie doesn&#x27;t exist in the vacuum. The 1991 animated
classic is essentially the same movie. Sure, this version includes some
more backstory for the supporting cast, but it&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s
necessary. Some of the changes are good and some are bad. In the end,
the changes are a wash to the movie&#x27;s overall quality.As for the stuff they didn&#x27;t change, it&#x27;s near identical to the
original. It&#x27;s to the point where they almost certainly just cut and
pasted pages of 1991&#x27;s script into this movie. As an example of the
changes, there&#x27;s a key point in this movie where things play out as
they did in 1991, however, some details are altered such that the end
product doesn&#x27;t make sense.All the classic songs make a return in decent covers by the new cast.
However, they also add new songs. If you&#x27;ve just emerged from a cave
after 30 years, there&#x27;s an easy way to tell which are the classic songs
and which are new: the classic songs are the good ones.Fact is, while this is a solid movie on it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s impossible to
recommend when in-essence this movie already exists. If you&#x27;re a huge
Beauty and the Beast fan and await with bated-breath any incarnation of
this story, then wait no more, you&#x27;ll probably have fun with this. The
rest of us should save our money and rent the 1991 movie.

Ah, these time-honoured classic stories, such easy money for the
studios. Well, maybe not that easy. Although this one has had
megadollars thrown at it, it never gets off the ground. Emma Watson in
the lead is, I think, attempting feistiness, but although it may be a
part of her in spirit, it doesn&#x27;t communicate itself to an audience
from the screen. Nor is Dan Stevens&#x27; easy charm up to the demands of
the prince-beast, not helped by the bestial side being entirely CGI
instead of motion-capture: a strange decision.The extra songs by Alan Mencken and Tim Rice don&#x27;t add anything much to
the score of the 1991 animated film. Emma Thompson&#x27;s rendition of the
title number does, however, match Angela Lansbury&#x27;s original, both in
warmth and sparkle. I&#x27;m sad to say that it&#x27;s pretty much the only
example of something in this new version rising to such a comparison.The production design is brilliant and sumptuous but, at the mercy of
the choice of 18th century France as the movie&#x27;s chosen period,
sometimes feels crowded in the frame, over-busy, fussy. The costumes
somehow rise above this limitation, especially in the finale.Of the other performers, Ewan McGregor and Audra McDonald shine out,
but Luke Evans, as vain, villainous Gaston, gives dynamic, high-octane
value, wiping the floor with both Ms Watson and Mr Stevens.I&#x27;ve no doubt it&#x27;ll make its budget back in gazillions, but, unlike the
studio&#x27;s revamped Jungle Book, this is decidedly second-hand.

Call me a poor sport or a fun killer or someone who takes movies too
seriously or even a film critic, but as a movie-goer I found this
live-action remake to be completely unnecessary and all together
forgettable, just like that 2015 live-action Disney adaption of
Cinderella. Remember that one?...I didn&#x27;t think so. Synopsis: This &#x22;tale as old as time&#x22; (adapted from Disney&#x27;s 1991
animated Beauty and the Beast) once again tells the story of a vain
prince who is turned into a hideous beast, until he can find a young
girl who is able to see his inner beauty and fall in love with him.
This &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; does have some entertaining moments of its
own creation, mainly when Cogsworth and Lumiere (played to perfection
by Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor) take center stage. But that&#x27;s about
all. Basically everything else I enjoyed about this movie was plucked
directly from the 1991 animated version; a version which is arguably
one of the greatest Disney films/musicals ever made. Now while I
usually hate when people compare remakes to their originals, since when
critiquing a film you really want to take that singular film experience
and analyze it in as much of a &#x22;bubble&#x22; as humanly possible, in regards
to Disney&#x27;s live-action &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;, this is simply
impossible since it&#x27;s pretty much a 80-90% shot for shot remake
(obviously there are going to be things that must be altered when
adapting straight from animation, i.e. you can&#x27;t possibly show Luke
Evans who plays Gaston, eating five dozen eggs unless you want him
dead). The main alterations being: the live-action element (or course)
the addition of a few new and completely forgettable songs and (spoiler
alert) LeFou (played by Josh Gad) is gay now, which probably would have
been seen as a more progressive move by Disney if he&#x27;d been in more
than four scenes. Bill Condon&#x27;s direction was serviceable, highlighted only by the set
design and choreography during the musical numbers, but the CGI was
cartoonish to the point of sloppy at times. As for the other
performances, Emma Watson as Belle was fine (undoubtedly this would&#x27;ve
been my very same critique if she&#x27;d starred in &#x22;La La Land&#x22;) and so was
Evans as Gaston. And even though as an actor Dan Stevens, who plays the
Beast, usually annoys me because I believe his acting to be 99% facial
expression, this facial recognition based CGI character seemed to suit
him quite well. Final Thought: I&#x27;m still giving this movie a minimal recommendation
only because it&#x27;s not a bad film. As I said, there are entertaining
moments, and the songs brought over from the 1991 version are always a
pleasure to hear. But if you&#x27;re going to pay money and take your kids
to see &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;, why not just stay home and watch the
better version?

Beauty and the Beast is live action adaptation of the beloved 90&#x27;s
animation of the same name. It follows the nerdy Belle as she leaps off
her small provincial town to be trapped in the mysterious world of the
Beast. I would not lie, this film really leaves a lot of things to be
talked about as it really is quite a mixed bag of positives and
negatives. To start off my discussion, the first half of the film is very
confusing. It felt like a lot of exposition needed to firmly root the
relationships within this updated film were left out. I could not help
but be lost at times when some &#x27;different-from-the- original&#x27; moments
happens every now and then. Also, it negatively affected the setup of
some scenes further down the film. In addition, the first half of the
film was oddly centered in showcasing the film&#x27;s special effects and
uncomfortably darker than expected.Secondly, a lot of acting in this film left me with very mixed
feelings. Emma Watson just did not do it for me as Belle. Though the
modern interpretation of Belle is interesting to say the least , Watson
does not have enough charisma to carry her character. Also, while I do
not see anything bad staying true to the original, I was really
bothered by some awful voice acting in this film. If they cannot make a
good impression of the original , then maybe change it up. I cannot
stop cringing every time I hear awful voice impression every now and
then.Lastly, the effects in this film is shockingly wonky. Given that this
is a huge production, I am kinda disappointed how the CGI characters is
very stilted and hindered some of the framing in this film, especially
those scenes including Mrs.Potts. Also, those CGI pan shots are
migraine hazards, gosh. Those scenes were the worst. On the positive side, when the Beast and Belle started to appear
together and the romance portion of the film starts to pick up,
everything just suddenly worked for the better. The mood, the story and
the changes are just better than the first half. Also, I kinda find the
lightening of the overall mood of the film greatly lift the film from
its intensely stiff first half. Acting wise, Luke Evans and Olaf takes this film. They were both stayed
true to the original yet their expressed it as their very own. They
pretty much stole the show every time they are on the screen. In
addition, Ewan Mcgrewor and Ian Mckellen were amazing in their
respective voice role as Lumiere, and Cogsworth. Overall, Disney&#x27;s live-action film update to the much beloved animated
film is a mix high highs and low lows but in the end, the film stayed
true to what the original intended to be and it kinda worked. I might
not say it is better than the original (which, take note, also did not
do it for me) but it is an admirable try and surely an enjoyable
watch[3/5]

There has been not a few publicity attention-grabbers, intentional or
otherwise. I like to get them out of the way first.1. Emma vs Emma. For La La Land, I can visualize Watson to be just as
good as Stone and therefore yes, she probably missed an Oscar. For
B&#x26;TB, however, Stone may not quite reach the level of spirited defiance
that Watson either possesses innate or nurtured through the ten years
of Hermione-ism.2. The gay scene(s). Sorry, I must have blinked and miss them.3. The scene paying tribute to &#x22;The sound of music&#x22;. If what we are
after is a similar temperament for adventure, Gigi (1958) would be a
better example than Maria.4. Emma Thompson is no match for Angela Lansbury. Myth, totally. If you
have heard Lansbury&#x27;s inadequate singing in &#x22;The Pirates of Penzance&#x22;
(1983) you&#x27;ll see. Even for the title song of B&#x26;TB, Thompson is
noticeably better than Lansbury.For musicals, one would be hard pressed to find music that are better
than Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s or lyrics that surpass Alan Jay Lerner&#x27;s. As
a musical, B&#x26;TB does not have the stuff to justify a claim to anything
more than average. It was quite a while ago when I saw this musical in
Broadway and that was a re-run. The only number I remember is the very
lovely title song. Watching this latest movie version, therefore, I
cannot even tell which are the four new songs written specifically for
the movie. They are mostly pleasing to the ear, but that&#x27;s about it.I mentioned earlier that Watson can be an equally good Mia while Stone
may come slightly short as Belle. This I consider to be an unreserved
compliment that Watson deserves. Playing the Beast is the
unrecognizable (expected, in makeups) and not-entirely-recognizable
(even without makeups)Dan Stevens. I am talking about one of the
best-liked characters in &#x22;Downton Abbey&#x22;, Matthew Crawley. In B&#x26;TB, the
dashing prince is only cameo. As the Beast,even behind the torturous
makeup, Stevens delivers soul trapped with the Beast. Sings well too,
as &#x22;Evermore&#x22; testifies to. Luke Evans takes a holiday from his heroic
portrayal of the guy who shot the dragon in the Hobbits trilogy to
deliver the part-comical, part-despicable Gaston. Josh Gad is the
mandatory, and somewhat campy, sidekick. Best among the in
flesh-and-blood support character is Kevin Kline playing Belle&#x27;s father
Maurice. With an Oscar to show, acting for Kline is no issue. You may
forget he can sing too as well demonstrated in &#x22;De-Lovely&#x22; (2004) and
above-mentioned &#x22;The Pirates of Penzance&#x22; (1983). Less noticeable than
the love story but equally affecting in this movie is the
father-daughter rapport. Note how, in the opening scene, Belle seems to
be reading Maurice&#x27;s mind and hands him the tools he needs. Later, the
sentiment is reprised in the lock-picking scene. The chemistry between
Kline and Watson holds its own when compared with that between Stevens
and Watson. Just one more to mention is Hattie Morahan as the
Enchantress. Those who have seen her in &#x22;Mr Holmes&#x22; is unlikely to
forget her as the mysterious woman in the unsolved (until the end of
the movie) case.Now, to the voice-backing characters (with brief cameos in
flesh-and-blood). More odd couple paring here. Ewan McGregor as Lumiere
the candlestick and Ian McKellen as Cogsworth the clock are delightful
with, respectively, over-the-top French accent and well timed gruff
jabs. McGregor also delivers respectable singing even if they do not
remind you of his romantic crooning in &#x22;Moulin Rouge&#x22; (2001). Equally
delightful is the musical pair Stanley Tucci as the
maestro-turned-piano and Audra McDonald as the singing wardrobe. Last
but not least is aforementioned Emma Thompson as the maternal tea pot,
best icing on the cake you can find.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Another inferior remake of a very good movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
People be advised; Disney industries are taking good old movies and
remaking them in a cheap and fast way in order to extract new money out
of older ideas. Recent Kong Island is a simple example. The movie is
basically about half of Peter Jackson&#x27;s King Kong version; but with
lower productions values; minimum writing and barely no character
definition (well Kong OK).This Beauty and the Beast has most digital images than the animated
version; so considering this more realistic is no more than a joke. I
give that Emma Watson (out of Ermione) was a good choice; she is
capable, has charisma and obviously is drawing a lot of kids to the
movie (who loved her on the Harry Potter&#x27;s series). The rest; however
is forgettable.Lumiere and Gaston steal the show as on the animated version; however
while Chris Evans is able to do something with his character; Ewan Mc
Gregor has not such luck since he is basically an animation that has a
lot less to do than the original.The lowest point is the &#x22;Be my guest&#x22; song; which was one of the
highest achievement in the other version. The scene is confusing and
not even nice to see. The ballroom scenes (another higher point of the
original; nothing here).There are a couple of new songs that add nothing new or interesting and
a few changes on the characters like the unnecessary rewriting as LeFou
as gay. I understand that Disney wants to run with times; but this was
no more than a very lame (and offensive) comic relief.I am not sure if Bill Condon (a sometimes good director ) was
responsible or Disney executives did it; but this a cash cow that will
make money but kill the flock.In brief; get the animated version and forget this crap
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disappointed...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Frankly, I was disappointed. I don&#x27;t like musicals in general, but I
had high hopes for this one. Not so much....Belle fell pretty flat for
me, flat voice, flat acting...she constantly reminded me of Hermione.
The knick-knack characters were much more charming and had better
dialogue. The beast was well done...his face was expressive, showed a
lot of emotion. Until he turned into Dan Stevens. I&#x27;m glad I saw it,
but this was not a memorable experience for me.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A frustrating under-delivery<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie is not terrible, but it left me feeling deeply unsatisfied.
I&#x27;m not placated by a mere nostalgia-driven rehash - I actually want a
good movie, one good enough to stand on its own. That is where this
film fails to deliver. Bluntly, the whole thing felt &#x22;cheap&#x22; and shallow. The story line is
virtually unchanged, and in fact most of the scenes and dialogue are
lifted directly from the 1991 film. However, what was left out was the
real heart and soul of the original, the subtlety of it, leaving this
one flat and emotionless. Emma Watson, however talented, is no Belle;
meanwhile the lovableness of the supporting characters is gone, traded
for one-dimensional and at times bombastic caricatures. (Cogsworth, my
favorite character as child, is completely forgettable in this
version.) Most egregiously, the character of the Beast is generally lessened. He
was a mysterious character in the original and, to four-year-old me, a
legitimately terrifying one. This made his internal transformation as
dramatic and dynamic as his external one in 1991. Not so in 2017. He is
made frivolous in the movie&#x27;s beginning, his rage is missing from its
middle, and there is no poignancy to his heartbreak or love in the end.
Talk about having the emotional range of a teaspoon - I see why they
cast Hermione. Not to mention his visual appearance is just... strange.
I detest the goat horns, and something about his eyes is perpetually
off. It is honestly distracting. On to things added to the movie: first off is obviously live action. I
don&#x27;t understand this one. Why bother to make a live-action version and
then design EVERYTHING to look cheap and fake and unrealistic anyway? I
wanted this movie brought to life, not just reanimated with CGI. And
then there is the music. I also didn&#x27;t really need another musical,
particularly if it was going to be one with frail voices, botched
rearrangements, and new pieces that are cheesy and ill-fitting. Beast
sings. More specifically, he sings at moment when he was roaring his
heart out in the original (if that tells you anything). There&#x27;s also
the teleporter-book. Not sure what that is supposed to be about. It
seems like nothing more than a contrived plot device added to reinforce
the inclusion of Belle&#x27;s backstory, which itself doesn&#x27;t really wind up
adding to the movie overall. I could write another paragraph about the misplaced, token diversity
peppering this movie, which I find infinitely more offensive than
outright white-washing, but I won&#x27;t. A few good things: it&#x27;s still a nostalgic watch. And your kids will
like it, if that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re going. This one also makes a few more
nods to the original 1740 fairy tale, which I find refreshing coming
from Disney. Gaston still gets what he&#x27;s got coming. But that&#x27;s about
it.Bottom Line: If you are an adult looking for a solid new take on your
old favorite, this is not it. If you are an adult looking for grown- up
version of your old favorite, this is definitely not it. If you&#x27;re
looking for a way to entertain your kids for two hours, go have fun. Or
let them go have fun, and stay home and watch the 1991 version while
they&#x27;re gone.

I am giving 5/10 because of its good picturization,otherwise I would
have given this 2/10.CGI effect in movie is really very poor.Beast in
the movie is really very boring character and doesn&#x27;t look real.I mean
this is 2017 and many movies like Planet Apes ,Life of pie has shown
the world how far CGI effect has improved and yet Disney has not done
justice with this movie.Plot is not much strong.Repeated songs in movie seems boring ,personally I am not the big fan
of musical dramas.I love Emma Watson,she is really adorable in the
movie but the beast has ruined the movie and faded her performance .End
is also not so good and was very predictable.Other characters rather than Emma and beast are complete mess . I have
added this movie to my list of worst movies ever watched and will never
had glimpse of this movie in future. Sorry guys about my negative
review,and if I hurt anyone&#x27;s feeling.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not bad, but not as great as expected. Deceiving trailer.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Firstly I have to say it, have we been watching the same movie? Emma
Watson just wasn&#x27;t able to pull off Belle, she did her best but I
didn&#x27;t buy it. Her smile never feels sincere or have much warmth in it,
her default expression always seems angry, which is also out of her
control but not the right fit for Belle. As others have stated she
isn&#x27;t at the peak of her craft yet. Some of the humour takes away from
the mystique of the film. The other actors did well and the CGI was
incredible. The commercial sort of made the movie out to be less of a
musical but that wasn&#x27;t the case. There is tons of singing in the film,
which I felt was deceiving as I thought there would only be maybe 2
songs in it, it wasn&#x27;t overdone but I just anticipated a big change.
The last 15 minutes of the film is very entertaining but as a whole the
film won&#x27;t be among the top Disney films ever made. Still a decent film
and easy on the eyes. The visuals are the biggest winner and main
reason to watch more than once.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>If it ain&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t remake it<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty in the Beast is the remake of the Disney classic of the same
name. The original Disney film is a classic, but will this film hold
up?In my opinion, no. And here is why: This movie has some astounding CGI
and a great production design. The film also contains mostly great
performances. Still, these aesthetic aspects cannot make a movie an
instant classic.There is no reason for a remake other than making money. This film is
shot-to-shot the original movie with some extra songs and some (rather
controversial) change to a character in the story that had no reason to
be there other than create buzz for the film.Think of this movie like the &#x22;Psycho&#x22; remake by Vince Vaughn except not
that bad. It is exactly like the original only that in this case, we
get to see it played by actors.If this movie had some reason for existing, I would give it a better
grade; because all the characters and the story are still very
memorable and good, but the original is the one responsible for that,
not the remake.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Has the magic deserted this retold Disney classic?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Where fortune favors the brave, this live-action adaptation of a
storied classic fails to venture into uncharted territory, instead
feeling as though the storyteller is hastily and mechanically executing
a sequence of scenes per shareholders&#x27; best interests. Throughout the
course of this film was bereft a certain magical sensation better
evoked by the original animated telling of the &#x27;tale as old as time&#x27;.
Nothing stands out as being particularly inspiring in this new Beauty
and the Beast. No risks are taken. The greatest value is enjoyed in the
CGI artistry which indeed is dazzling, yet feels manufactured in order
to mask what little depth lies in the storytelling and characters.
Thankfully, this version does nothing to taint the well-deserved
acclaim garnered by it&#x27;s predecessor, which will continue to be
cherished by many and to many (including myself) will remain the
obvious preference of the two pictures.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A walk down memory lane, but nothing more.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
What I liked most was the music. It brought back so many memories. It
was so beautiful I had to buy the soundtrack album shortly after
watching. Emma Watson has a great singing voice (I assume that was her
singing and she wasn&#x27;t lip syncing to another vocalist?). Unfortunately that&#x27;s where the praise ends.The CGI had it&#x27;s moments but at times it was so poor. I&#x27;m referring to
the wolves and most of the scenes where Belle and the Beast share the
same screen. And is it just me or did Belle&#x27;s village look like a dummy
set made out of cardboard? If you have any recollection of the 1991 animation (yes, it was 26
years ago!) then much of this will be a chore to watch. Is it worth the
cinema ticket price? For the nostalgia, yes. But then again you might
be better off staying in, saving your money and watching the original
animation at home. You won&#x27;t be missing much. What could have been a great film retelling the story of a young woman
falling in love with a cursed prince, turned into an boring copy of the
original, with the only changes being for the worse.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Visually stunning, otherwise underwhelming<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Although a film&#x27;s watch-ability may not be directly implied by its
Academy Award nods, there is a reason why the 1991 version became the
first animated feature film ever to be nominated for the Best Picture
category. That version had everything: gorgeous animation, songs of
warmth and affection, tremendous voice acting, and a story that was
both traditional and far-ahead of its time. We all know how Belle,
well-read as she is and dissatisfied with her laid-back village life,
longs for adventure. Her father, the eccentric inventor Maurice, is a
kind of a bumbling simpleton at first, but is indeed a caring parent
and protective of his precocious daughter, whose talents are not lost
on him. A village which at once becomes a mob on the mere whim of a
deeply narcissistic, insecure person. With such an impression, I was hoping that the live-action version
would take the film&#x27;s already-legendary status even further and make it
an all-time classic. Alas, I have to admit I am disappointed. There are
several things in this film that were not in the animated version: the
lead protagonists&#x27; backgrounds are more defined, there is a minor twist
in the final act, Le Fou&#x27;s predicament is more deserving of empathy
than the foolish sidekick he was in 1991 are the ones that come to
mind. First up, the story. It stays largely faithful to the original (save
for the twist I mentioned above). The humor works rather well, but is
rather forced at times, leading to some awkward chemistry between the
lead pair as well as between Gaston and Le Fou. In terms of
progression, here is where I felt let down: Beast offering his gigantic
library as a token of affection to Belle was a pivotal moment in the
animated version, it made Belle realize that there is a softer side to
her ferocious host. The title song also feels a bit flat; when Angela
Lansbury sang with her heart, you could feel the quickening of the
heartbeats, the racing of the pulses, and the irresistible magic of the
moment when Belle and the Beast dance in the ballroom. As Belle finally
trusts Beast by resting her head on his shoulder and the Beast is
totally taken by surprise, his servants encourage him further,
enhancing the timelessness of both the film and the song. Sadly, the
live action has no such charm. The build-up is rushed, the song ends
before you can realize what is happening, and Emma Thompson, as
celebrated a thespian she is, tries her best but is unable to match
Lansbury&#x27;s memorable rendition. I was also disappointed to not see
&#x22;Being Human&#x22; in this film, it was a song that demonstrated the
servants&#x27; aspirations and could have served to illustrate how their
lives where before the curse took effect. And with just a touch over
two hours, the film&#x27;s pace seems prolonged and ponderous.I am not sure if the lead pair is miscast. On their own, they are
pretty efficient: Emma Watson is convincing in her portrayal of a
forward-thinking Belle. Dan Stevens is left to bare his soul as a
tortured fiend, which he does mostly well. But its when they are
together that feels a bit underwhelming. Paige O&#x27;Hara and Robby
Benson&#x27;s chemistry in 1991 was terrific and amazing, the former&#x27;s
gentle civility perfectly contrasting the latter&#x27;s jarring cruelty and
eventually transformed elegant nobility. It was refreshing to see Le
Fou (played by the excellent Josh Gad) have a human side to him, which
made his performance all the more relevant in these times. Luke Evans
is equally superb, as the obnoxiously self- centered Gaston who
manipulates people to his will. Kevin Kline deserves plaudits for his
portrayal as well. However, I don&#x27;t think Ewan McGregor was that
convincing as a French candelabra, to be honest. With an odd French
accent, his banter-filled exchanges with Cogsworth lack the rapier wit
of Jerry Orbach-David Ogden Stiers&#x27; double team. The film does have
some positives though: Le Fou&#x27;s characterization, the lead pair&#x27;s
backstory (both mentioned above), and the stunningly exquisite
production design. The detailing was intricate and dazzling, especially
in the castle&#x27;s interiors and Belle&#x27;s ballroom gown. Overall, this film works, but in hindsight, I should have watched this
without much expectation. So that would be recommendation.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Keeping true to the animated classic, and the fact that art is a receptacle of cultural units, resulted in an anti-gay, pro-ISIS, materialistic film!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Believe me, I was as surprised as you are.1. The depiction of LGBT characters merely for comic relief, and quite
distastefully in that;2. promoting punishing others (and their relatives) for not sharing our
beliefs IN THEIR OWN HOME (the Enchantress&#x27; punishment of the Prince)
is practically what ISIS do in Syria;3. conflating kidnapping and Stockholm Syndrome with love; and4. justifying the practice of brainwashing.All these disturbing themes and elements are what we find in this film,
which might have been alright for children in an older time, but is
certainly dissonant in our age and time.On a more cinematic note, Emma Watson appears more like a CG doll. It
is as if she was meant to come across as non-human. Her expressions,
her smirk, added to her clear and perfect singing voice, all contribute
to a non-human impression.The film is a nice nostalgic material, but its outdatedness and the now
disturbing messages it has make up for a very dissonant and conflicting
viewing experience.

1991&#x27;s &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; is not just my favourite animated film,
speaking as a huge animation fan and who loves most of Disney&#x27;s films,
but also one of my favourite films.Expectations were very much mixed going to see this live-action
retelling, having thoroughly enjoyed 2015&#x27;s &#x27;Cinderella&#x27; and 2016&#x27;s
&#x27;The Jungle Book&#x27; (which were visually gorgeous and combined old and
new while retaining the spirits of their animated counterparts). Also
being familiar with Bill Condon&#x27;s previous work, and finding him a
generally promising director and writer. &#x27;Gods and Monsters&#x27; is amazing
and one of my favourites, &#x27;Kinsey&#x27; was interesting and &#x27;Dreamgirls&#x27; was
elevated by the soundtrack and the cast was quite decent, before he
dropped the ball with the last two &#x27;Twilight&#x27; films which were not good
films at all through no real fault of Condon but with a good deal of
everything else.At the same time, some of the casting was dubious (Emma Watson is not
as bad an actress as many say but to me she just wasn&#x27;t my idea of
Belle, though the likes of Ian McKellen and Emma Thompson promised a
lot) and considering that the 1991 film is such a masterpiece in every
area (to me the animated &#x27;Cinderella&#x27; and &#x27;The Jungle Book&#x27; are great
films but nothing compared to &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27;) comparisons were
always going to be inevitable. Not comparing was always going to be
hard when it was such a staple of my, and many others&#x27;, childhood.
Really questioned the point of it too. Seeing it for myself with no
prejudice, and writing this review reading as few reviews as possible,
this retelling is not a patch on the 1991 film, it doesn&#x27;t disgrace it
but what worked so well before is missing. On its own terms, it&#x27;s also
very problematic. Just for the record, in no way is it awful, but my
feelings were exactly the same as initial expectations, mixed.Starting with the great things, most of &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; (2017)
looks amazing. The set design is colourful and incredibly lavish, with
equally gorgeous costumes (especially Belle&#x27;s yellow ball gown which is
even nicer than the dress Watson wore in &#x27;Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire&#x27;) and everything is exquisitely photographed. The original
songs, some of Disney&#x27;s finest ever, from the 1991 film are maintained,
and as masterful as ever, while the instrumental score is rousing,
layered and beautiful.Of the renditions of the songs, the best one is the Busby
Berkeley-inspired jaw-dropping extravaganza &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;. &#x22;Gaston&#x22; is
also enormous fun, and hurrah for one of the best song lyrics ever
being kept &#x22;I use antlers in all my decorating&#x22; and while Thompson&#x27;s
performance of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is nothing compared to the iconic
one of Angela Lansbury in one of the greatest scenes in all animation
it is still poignant.The supporting cast do fare better than the leads, with Luke Evans
being the standout, performing Gaston with gusto and menace. Josh Gad
is great fun as LeFou, and regarding the controversy for me it has been
blown out of proportion and nowhere near as explicit as seemingly
implied, it&#x27;s actually pretty subtle and will go over the heads of
younger audiences. Ewan McGregor is clearly enjoying himself as
Lumiere, despite sporting a dodgy accent (though a French accent is not
easy), while McKellen is a wonderfully stuffy Cogsworth, Stanley Tucci
is a great addition and Thompson a sincere Mrs Potts. Chip is very cute
too, and Lumiere and Plumette&#x27;s chemistry is sweet and amusing without
being creepy.However, am of the opinion that Watson and Dan Stevens are miscast.
Watson is far too earnest for Belle and a lot of her line delivery is
both forced and phoned in. Stevens often looks stiff and uncomfortable
as Beast, being very cheaply made up, and his eyes look dead. Beast was
a fascinating character before but has been stripped of his complexity
and soul. The chemistry between them, something that would have made or
broken the film, isn&#x27;t there. Audra MacDonald overdoes it in the role
of the wardrobe and Kevin Kline tries his best but his Maurice is
largely wasted.Special effects and such are a mixed bag. Some of it fares well but
some of it looks pretty dreadful, especially Chip, the wolves and
Beast. One admires the fact that &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; tries to remain
faithful to the animated film, but one can&#x27;t help feeling that it was
too faithful and that the spirit generally was lost in translation.
There is not much new, though trying with additional songs that are so
lacking compared to the original songs (&#x22;Evermore&#x22; is forgettable and
completely lacks impact) and cramming in numerous back-stories that
mostly bloats the film and like a rich pudding being over-egged. Belle
and Maurice&#x27;s subplot feels like padding and eats up too much time.Not all the original song renditions work, with &#x22;Belle&#x22; lacking joy and
being pedestrian in staging, &#x22;Something There&#x22; being similarly
indifferent and underpowered in singing. The climax, so powerful before
with a tense final fight and Beast&#x27;s death scene and transformation
even now reducing me to floods of tears every time, this time round
feels like a lukewarm anti-climax. The beautifully crafted script
before is both dull and overdone here, the story lacks magic, joy,
charm, soul and emotional power that only appears sporadically and the
pacing suffers from the film trying to do too much.In summary, &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; (2017) looks gorgeous with a strong
supporting cast and a few song renditions that come off well but
suffers from being over-stuffed, miscast leads and feeling very bland
in spirit. 5/10 Bethany Cox
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Emma Watson???? What were they thinking?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really don&#x27;t get the attraction to Emma Watson. She&#x27;s not pretty and
not a very good actress. And why does Hollyweird insist on ramming their homosexual agenda down
our throats? &#x22;Methinks thou dost protest too much!&#x22; The more you try to
bully people to see things your way, the more we won&#x27;t believe you.
Family movies are not the place for you to try and convince people your
views are OK. Kevin Kline is a great actor and I was happy there was one good actor
in this movie. As usual, the beast looks better with the makeup on.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty and the Beast Lacks the Beauty<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I just want to say that if people like Emma Waston, that&#x27;s fine but if
you&#x27;re a huge fan of hers, I suggest you don&#x27;t read this review.Now I love the original animated Beauty and the Beast so I knew this
movie wouldn&#x27;t live up to the original. With that being said, this new
movie does have some merits. The CGI in this movie is rather good and
the scenery is beautiful. I also love what they did with the castle. In
a way, the castle feels alive too and I thought that was a great twist.
The costumes are also really gorgeous. As for acting, everyone delivers a great performance save for one
actress who I&#x27;ll get to in a minute. Luke Evans was stellar as Gaston.
You can tell he was enjoying himself and was amazing. Josh Gad of
course was funny as always. Ewan McGregor did a rather good job as
Lumiere and Ian McKellan was a pretty decent Cogsworth. You also have
Stanley Tucci, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Audra McDonald and Emma Thompson also
giving it their all. Now as for the Beast, he was decent. I haven&#x27;t
seen Dan Stevens in anything but this and I thought he did an okay job.
He could have been better but I thought he was fine.But the worst part of this movie is Emma Watson.Again, if you like Emma that is fine but she was not the right choice
of Belle. Not only do they not even try to make her look like Belle but
she doesn&#x27;t feel like Belle. She tries to deliver classic Belle lines
but it sounds like she doesn&#x27;t trust the lines. She feels so awkward
and stiff. Every line feels beyond forced and nothing about it feels
organic. And the biggest issue is her singing voice. I know Emma isn&#x27;t
a trained singer but even so, that doesn&#x27;t really change the fact that
she cannot hold a tune. She&#x27;s boring, bland and just all around dull.If you are dying to see this movie, I say go for it but I really think
you&#x27;re better waiting for the DVD.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>hear warming at times<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Lets make it clear this movie is not horrible but it leaves you
unsatisfied. This is the second Disney classic being remade into a live
action film with an almost exact 1|1 replication the other one being
Jungle book and while I liked both movies I have to say this movie fell
a little bit farther from the tree than what you would want. The big
problem here was underdeveloped characters. The animation at less time
could develop the characters far better and I wonder why that is. The
thing that was amiss here was almost any passion put in by the actors
except for GASTON! Luke Evans stole the show with his depiction of
Gaston he was evil and selfish and arrogant through and through and we
could believe him. Lefou portrayed by Josh Gad was a more endearing
character than in the animation since here he had more characteristics
than: &#x22;he just is a dumb and evil dude&#x22;. Here he does deliver some of
the lines that in the animation were delivered with little to no
meaning with new take and his growing distrust for Gaston is a nice
take however he is more like a clown than a gay man that wants nothing
more than being recognized by Gaston. It would have been much better
for his character to make an active decision to leave Gaston behind
instead of a decision out of petty revenge. He could have easily been
there to help break free Belle and his father. Now then lets get to
Belle&#x27;s father, he is just not there! This character is so bland and
empty we could have easily done this without him. Gone is the
adventurous inventor of the animation whose influence you clearly could
see on Belle. Instead you get an artist with few dialogues and a face
that is devoid of emotions. He is not endearing and warm and this in
turn hurts Belle. The other side cast includes Sir Ian Mckellen a
supreme actor that his voice is heard through the lifeless cgi but can
do little to make the cgi character come to life as the CGI is done
with a boring color pallet and the character designs for the color
pallet used are too complex and make it hard to see their expressions
and movements specially when you deal with Lumiere and Cogsworth since
there is a lot of metallic golden shades used on them which makes their
different body parts less than recognisable. Emma Thompson is there and
and I couldn&#x27;t care less, it has been a long time that I have lost all
interest for her work and this movie didn&#x27;t help either. Then we go to
Belle. Oh boy what am I to say, Emma Watson is a Harry Potter child and
has been doing good. However Emma Watson was kind of underwhelming here
and I don&#x27;t know if it is the Harry Potter movies creeping through the
image reminding one of all the other times you have seen her in similar
situations or the fact that Belle has been hurt by the Maurice (father)
character. She is good, she can sing, she can deliver the lines very
well but the whole thing is just very bland and I think I know what the
real issue is: the cgi leaves little for actor to work with. It seems
like she has not evolved much beyond her Harry Potter years.The Beast has been butchered! his character&#x27;s complexity, out of the
window and the cgi makes him even less relatable. In the animation from
the very beginning you see that he is a creature with feelings and
intelligence, Beast is built with real scenes and dialogues not some
exposition on how &#x22;His father was cruel and when he lost his mother he
became like his father&#x22;. Here we get far less dialogues from Beast and
the emotion&#x27;s all gone. His scenes are few and too far inbetween. He
does not show any emotion except rage and hate early on so that when he
does show up to save Belle it makes no sense. His change into a kind
character comes out of the blue and leaves you wondering what happened.
Also when Belle leaves we get a Beast that is depressing not mournful
like what you saw of him in the animation where he is roaring and
howling into the sky, Here he is on top of the tower under rain with
head lowered and just looking down like he is Bruce Wayne or something.
what is going on here? I do not know what happened during production of
this movie, but it certainly was not good. The movie somehow manages to
deliver on almost every scene in the original and every line but with
very little enthusiasm and passion leaving it feeling like a cheap
knock off and not the authentic remake done by Disney.The songs are good and bring that nostalgia feeling but that is it. It
seemed some lyrics were modified for no reason. There were 2 new songs
if I&#x27;m not wrong and the &#x22;When we are human again&#x22; was gone which was
sad because that song was very important in building up the side cast
and castle.Why was the enchantress still around? Why didn&#x27;t she punish Gaston?
Also what is up with that book she left Beast as a punishment? Some
stuff make zero sense. As mentioned the songs are there and the
nostalgia factor is there and these two plus Evans and Gad are the
saving grace of this movie which is a shame because it could have been
far better. All in all there were scenes that tears welled up in my
eyes because of the nostalgia, this was most prevalent during the
songs. I give this movie a 6 out of 10 meaning above average. I just
hope that if Disney does make another live action remake they address
the issues in this movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Would love it but...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie was well done overall. It followed the plot of the original
but the several lbqt scenes didn&#x27;t add to the quality of the movie.
Agendas shouldn&#x27;t be in a movie that is supposed to be for families.
I&#x27;m not saying children should be shielded from that stuff, but that
doesn&#x27;t mean scenes like that need to be in a movie. I really would
have loved it and purchased it when it comes out on DVD if those
several scenes hadn&#x27;t been in it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not a beauty nor a beast, but presentable Disney offering<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
OK why make another Beauty &#x26; The Beast?I thought the older cartoon was pretty good and there are other film
versions. The reason for this remake of course, is to make more money
from a sure bet. With real actors, I thought maybe, it could have been made more
appealing to adults. It does play safe to the beloved fairytale and to politically correct
doctrine, include everybody, offend nobody. There is nothing bad about this film as such. They certainly did not
botch their version of a classic story. Minor criticisms (I am just knitpicking here) Emma Watson was unremarkable as Belle.I found the bursting into song every 5 minutes a little wearisome, and
I know this is heresy, but a little more popular music. Maurice (Belles father) was sliding off a snowy rocky outcrop about to
be eaten by wolves then suddenly he&#x27;s on his horse galloping away. All in all, it is, what it says on the tin. &#x22;Beauty &#x26; The Beast By Disney&#x22; I doubt it will be a &#x27;classic&#x27; I had a nagging feeling it just &#x27;missed
the boat&#x27; for it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Review of Beauty and the Beast<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast was one of my childhood favorites, and I was
excited to watch this one with my kids. I thought that they followed
the story line pretty well. I was not a huge fan of the Beast&#x27;s
physical features, I don&#x27;t know, I think I wanted him to look more like
the Beast from the original film. I felt that the singing was great and
all the actors did a great job portraying their characters and that
overall the film was pretty good. I just did not get the same great
feeling as when I watch the original.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Artificial Art<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Missing magic, for the entire film you&#x27;re waiting for a grande finale
trick that will make up for it all. Sadly the climax is fast tracked
and dull to say the least. The 2D tea party is the largest let down,
followed by a flame-less candle and a faceless clock. Artificial
artwork that should have been a painted dream, you&#x27;re left wondering
who had the permission to produce this, and had Walt been present,
would he have let Disney be involved.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Good - but...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
May be some spoilers for those who have never seen any version of
beauty and the beast. Of course the story is well known - nothing much
changes in this version. In fact, it&#x27;s pretty point by point with the
animated film. The sets and animation is quite good and they did choose
great actors for the characters, the costumes are wonderful and all the
singing is great. It just seemed to lack a bit of magic to me. The
scenes with Maurice didn&#x27;t seem to build up the drama about the beast
enough. The editing or pace was quite rushed in his scenes. Not enough
tension was built in so it didn&#x27;t make as much sense why Gaston would
do anything he did. It seems as if they wanted so much to build up the
gay character that they lost the story in favor of an agenda.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Main characters just too creepy<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As a huge fan of the original Disney animated pic, there were several
issues I had with this live action remake. Namely, the Beast and
Lumiere. The Beast&#x27;s horns made him look like the devil, as well as
nothing like the original Beast in the animated movie. Why change that?
It gave me the creeps. Also, making him two-legged only, instead of
sometimes four-legged like in the original movie was distracting. As
for Lumiere, there was nothing charming about his face at all. That too
was creepy, the kind of thing that scares you in your dreams. Thirdly, where was the delightful song, &#x22;Only Human Again,&#x22; by the
original team of Ashman and Mencken, that made it to the stage
production? That would have been much better than the forgettable tunes
by Mencken and Rice.And lastly, why mess with Beauty&#x27;s original gorgeous yellow dress? The
one Emma Watson wore was nice; it just wasn&#x27;t Beauty&#x27;s.So, I would not take little children to this movie. Let them enjoy the
original animated feature or the stage production. No bad dreams there.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Revelatory<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Went with my son to see a movie about a beauty and a beast not
expecting to witness a film about the new American president. Only when
Belle tells Gaston she cannot marry him because &#x22;there is no love in
your heart&#x22; does it occur to me the Gaston character is mirror image of
the current occupant of the White House. Narcissist on reveal, self
centered, indifferent to others, willing to deceive, defile, deflect
and behave in a categorically cruel, offensive and desultory manner, as
unlikable as any villain that could possibly be depicted. Thanks to the
producers for depicting a character more than vaguely familiar to
American audiences. Stunning similarities unveiled artfully.

In 1991, Beauty and the Beast made cinematic history, becoming the
first animated film ever to be nominated for a best picture Oscar. Now
26 years later the film is given the live action treatment by Disney,
following the success of other such films like; Maleficent, Cinderella
and The Jungle Book. 2017&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast retells the same story
from 26 years ago, but with impressive visuals and good acting, this
film serves as an acceptable remake of the classic original.The film is visually stunning, the cinematography and visual effects
work perfectly together to bring these, once animated characters and
settings to life. This is really all the film needed to achieve as the
story itself is exact same as the original 1991 animation, bar a few
plot point tweaks. Now that visual effects and animation has come along
way since the 90s, Disney wants to flaunt this with these remakes, as
evidenced by The Jungle Book winning a visual effects Oscar at this
years academy awards. Beauty and the Beast isn&#x27;t as CGI heavy and thus
visually impressive as Jon Favreau&#x27;s The Jungle Book, but it is still
beautiful to look at nonetheless.The acting as a whole was decent from the films all star cast, with a
particularly good performance from Luke Evans as Gaston. Luke Evan&#x27;s
completely outshines everyone in this film including its lead&#x27;s Emma
Watson and Dan Stevens. Evans sings impressively well and without the
aid of autotune *cough* Emma Watson *cough*. This overall theatrical
performance steals the entire show and completely makes this film worth
remaking.Also as a whole the film is well directed by Bill Condon, slowing the
pace to give way to more character development and to express the time
taken for the two title characters to fall in love. The controversial
(to certain countries) direction taken with LeFou was done in such a
delicate and implicit manner which was good to see, and also made this
film feel more contemporary.Overall, Beauty and the Beast does all it needed to do. It&#x27;s a well
acted and visually stunning film that tells the same story from 26
years ago. I commend Bill Condon and Luke Evans for their work on this
film, and thanks to them this remake isn&#x27;t just a heartless cash grab.
It may not be the most impressive of the live action remakes, but is by
far the most enjoyable in my own opinion.

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (2017) I was very excited about watching this film
but I finally found it a little bit boring. I think this is because I
already knew the story. In spite of that I think the film was perfectly
done. It shows all the essence of the real history and it makes you
travel back to your childhood. Another point in favour were the special
effects. They were very realistic and all the characters from the
enchanted castle were awesome. In conclusion I think it is
recommendable for everybody. It is a classic film remake into an
artwork, and if you want to have a good time with your kids it&#x27;s the
perfect occasion.

&#x22;The beautiful and the beast&#x22; is a good musical, a great adaptation,
with many hits, but also with some mistakes. With a script coming from
the animation of 91, we have some changes for the worse, like trying to
create a suspense over the beautiful mother, and solve this mystery in
a scene that completely escapes the rhythm of the movie, such a mystery
would not have to exist or could be solved In 2 min, because such a
plot is created for the development of the father&#x27;s character, but
really, it does not work, other small changes were the king&#x27;s employees
become more and more inanimate and the castle collapses more as the
pellets fall, that change was Great, more, the script follows the
pattern, with scenes equal to the animation - which is not bad - and a
great development of the village in relation to the beautiful and the
passion point between beautiful and the beast. The film talks about how
the quest for knowledge was something seen with strangeness, and the
film is completely full of diversity, I am against putting gay actors,
whites, blacks, women ... just to meet quota, &#x22;the beautiful and the
beast &#x22;Changes the character in an extremely natural way, and the
change gets even better. We have a photograph that mixes the white of
the village with the gray of the castle, we also have a great mix and
sound editing, a completely confused assembly, and we have a makeup and
a costume simply spectacular (a sure indication to Oscar in the
costumes). Emma watson is not a painter in terms of acting, but
fulfills her role as beautiful, and at times even charms, Josh Gad is
great, and incredible as it may seem, has an incredible chemistry with
the character of Luke Evans, at last , We have problems in the script,
and problems of continuity, but the film pleases, and much.

Beauty and the Beast It tells the classic story of Disney, in which a
Bella (Emma Watson) after its father (Kevin Kline) was imprisoned by
the Beast (Dan Stevens). After exchanging roles with her father, Bella,
is imprisoned by the Evil Beast?Let&#x27;s start with the actors. Emma Watson as Bella is a Disney hacienda,
unfortunately I went to see her in Spanish. For me the English seat is
the best there is. Dan Stevens as the Beast can not be said any more.
Because most of the work was done by the effects. But the character I
liked the most was Le Fou, interjected by Gosh Gad, after realizing
that he is on the bad side change sides, for a few moments. Ian
Mackellen and Ewwan McGregor (Cogsworth and Lumi&#xE8;re respectively)
seemed very good, a very important impulse to the film.The music is very well used, I would put one point less than La La
Land. It should also be said that La La Land and La Bella y la Bestia
have different styles of music. This very well used music in this
movie, it would not seem strange that I had an Oscar nomination for
best song or best soundtrack.Beautiful 7/10

I hadn&#x27;t seen the original cartoon until after I saw this remake.
Backwards? Yes, but it doesn&#x27;t matter really. Overall I did enjoy this
movie quite a bit. I do like some of the changes they made, such as
Cogsworth and Lumirie bringing Belle to her room and telling her not to
go to the west wing. One of things that bothered me, was that Gaston
looked too much like Bard from the Hobbit, granted same person plays
the characters, but they could have made better changes to the costume
and makeup to better differentiate the characters. I will say this,
they really over did the LeFou a lot more than they should&#x27;ve in my
opinion. Laid it on more thick than necessaryou, considering people
said it was subtle. To me it was very noticeable, and did in their
words made him, clingy.Really good movie, would not gone it 10/10, a lot more would have had
to be changed to make it a perfect movie, but worth seeing more than
once.

Beauty and the Beast has been one of my favorite childhood movies of
all time but the live action version just didn&#x27;t do it for me. It could
have been their casting choices or the fact that the animations just
felt weird but it just didn&#x27;t feel right to me. The movie followed the
storyline of the cartoon perfectly and I had no problem with that part
of it. My three main criticisms would have to be one the new songs that
were added just felt weak compared to its other musical masterpieces
like Be Our Guest, Beauty and The Beast, Gaston, and Belle. The new
songs just didn&#x27;t match up with the older ones. And I was surprised to
hear them. My second criticism would have to be about the ending scene
when the mob is storming the castle. It was anticlimactic and some of
my favorite scenes were removed. I was hoping for this big fun battle
like in the cartoon but it just didn&#x27;t translate into a live action
version. My last criticism would have to be one that I and many others
have had since the cartoon version. The big reveal of the prince at the
end of the movie. A lot of people say that the beauty budget was wasted
on Belle in the cartoon version of the movie when concerning the
Prince&#x27;s human form reveal. In the live action version, I spent the
entire movie hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed once again but
unfortunately I was. The only difference between the prince&#x27;s looks in
the live action and cartoon is in the cartoons Prince and Beast were
equal in the looks department and in the live action, the Beast looked
better. But overall the movie was okay. It wasn&#x27;t above or below my
expectations.

If you enjoyed the original animated classic, then you will like this
one. They did a wonderful job of the story and singing (Emma Watson is
enchanting!). Didn&#x27;t care for the horns on The Beast (made him look
like a Tiefling) - otherwise no complaints, CGI was done well. Disney
did a great job of redoing my own personal favorite Disney animated
movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Our group loved it<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have been awaiting for this movie for awhile now and yes I am a
Christian and was raised in church but let me tell you that I adored
the movie as did my sister and mother who watched the movie the action
level is superb and the story is wonderful I loved the beautiful Emma
Watson as Bell she is a good looking woman indeed I highly recommend
that you take the family to see the movie.oh yea PS if you are
concerned about the whole gay moment it is not a big deal yes lefo did
dance with A man and did a weird dance with Gaston during the song
Gaston. But aside from that it is a remarkable movie that is not to be
missed

26 years after the classic Disney film was released, Bill Condon
directs Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in a retelling of Beauty and the
Beast.This film was absolutely stunning. I sat and watched my childhood on
screen with real people for the first time in my life, and I am not
ashamed to admit I shed a tear once or twice. I grew up watching Emma
Watson as Hermoine, so seeing her on screen as my all time favourite
Disney Princess was highly emotional. The cinematography in this took my breath away. Every frame of this
film was stunning. The cinematography was beautifully done. The costume
designs were so expertly done, they all looked like they were direct
from the animated film. The casting was done so stupendously it was
like the original animations had just stepped out of the film and began
waltzing across the screen. The only two qualms I had were - It seemed to take Emma Watson a while to warm up to singing. It was
very rough in the first song of the film, and then she seemed to get
better as it went along.- The pacing of the film seemed quite rushed. I understand they were
pretty much copying the original animation, but I feel like it could
have been paced out just that little bit better. I felt a little out of
breath watching it, whizzing from one point to another. Those qualms aside, this still took my breath away. It definitely
deserves the hype it got. This was a wonderful retelling of such a
classic tale. I hope that this generation of children may enjoy this as
much as I enjoyed the original growing up. They deserve a movie like
this, full of love, hope and romance. And of course, the age old moral,
don&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover.

The live action update of the Oscar-nominated Disney animation, Bill
Condon&#x27;s re-imagining is a sweet, thoughtful and emotional film with
clear themes of empowerment, feminism and individuality.Emma Watson is perfectly cast as Belle and her singing is a real
show-stealer throughout; as are Luke Evans and Josh Gad as the comedic
yet villainous duo of Gaston and Lefue, respectively.&#xA0; On the flip
side, Dan Stevens as the Beast leaves a lot to be desired (not in a
good way), particularly in terms of his - albeit, limited - singing.The songs remain as catchy as ever and are beautifully (and
expensively) choreographed on screen with seamless combinations of live
action, CGI and what often appears as one shot camera work.Despite its 2hr 9min runtime however, the plot seems somewhat rushed
and bare bones at times.&#xA0; Admittedly, this is based on an existing
Disney property and storyline, so screenwriters were shackled in many
ways to the original material but the plot really felt like it could
have done with more back story around the Beast/Princes&#x27; troubled
childhood and how this fully justified his conduct as an adult (a la
Frozen).All in all though, this is a greatly enjoyable musical take on the
classic story which very much has its heart in the right place and
isn&#x27;t scared to pitch at both young and older audience members.&#xA0;
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great movie , potential a classic , but  an utterly immoral narrative<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I will give a thumb up for the movie as a movie great entertainment
However the story itself kinna bad Original fairy tales can very bloody
and cruel which is OK as fairy tales But as a movie it is a hostage
situation in which the bad person has won If you want to see a movie
about someone fallen in love with captors there are many which are made
better than this one. Try look them up in IMDb Most of them are somehow
based at this fairy tale, which is very niceHowever make the fairy tale into a movie, it is just bad form Some
fairy tales are just too (badwords) to be &#x22;translated&#x22; into motion
picture. So bad that I have to review this oneAgain, the movie as a movie is great actors and all the production
stuffs great Just the (badword) narrative, it is insane. ^^
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Missed Opportunites<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney&#x27;s latest live action remake is a wonderful trip down memory
lane, but it doesn&#x27;t really bring anything new to the table. It follows
the animated feature line for line, but with extra scenes and songs to
try and deepen the story a little. Those added details don&#x27;t really go
anywhere though, which is an unfortunate missed opportunity when you
have such fascinating source material to work with. Getting to see
these timeless characters reenacted with today&#x27;s talent was also a lot
of fun, and though they do look the part, their singing voices were
tainted with heavy doses of autotuning, and some just lacked energy all
together. It felt as if the filmmakers were holding themselves back
from making a more fleshed out version of the animated feature, but it
was still highly entertaining. The stunning visuals, all star cast, and
added details and songs make the story feel new again for today&#x27;s
audiences, but in the end, it reminds me why the first one was so
brilliant to begin with.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Comparison with another version<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
My critique will take the form of praise for another version of the
tale, the German TV version of 2012 by Marc-Andreas Borchert, listed in
IMDb and for which I wrote this review, as I say as a kind of cleansing
reaction to the live-action version of the great cartoon of 1991: I
wrote a review a few years ago about this TV film - asking Anglophone
viewers not to be put off by the German, since they would be missing
one of the most magical and moving versions of the tale. After seeing
the bloated new version by Disney I had to go back to it as a kind of
cleansing process. There are also some coincidences in the handling of
the story that make me think the US team must have been inspired by
this German version, some of the more poetic details &#x96; not in the
latest and to the 1991 cartoon version &#x96; in the Disney seem based on
ideas in Marc-Andreas Borchert&#x27;s wonderful film. The main theme of
transformation through love is enacted with utter credibility and
convincing emotion, so there is great suspense that beast may not
survive after all, making it a thriller as well as a dramatic love
story. It plays in glorious Alpine scenery in castles both ruined and
splendid, the music by Stephan Maria Schneider very moving, the actors
ideal, a complex charismatic Beast and beautifully down-to-earth
beauty, elements of humour; I cannot praise it enough and beg all to
see it as an antidote to Hollywood megalomania (by which I do not mean
the brilliant 1991 cartoon version!).

(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#xBD; out of 5 ) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A second-hand knock-off that rarely touches the original&#x27;s
beauty but still entertains.JIM&#x27;S REVIEW: The Hollywood Remake. A strange breed of movie it is. It
is not a sequel adding more to an already told tale. It&#x27;s more like a
parasite leeching onto someone else&#x27;s ideas and crediting themselves
with all of the glory. Those who loved the original will look upon this
new attempt with disdain, those who disliked the predecessor will
question the filmmaker&#x27;s motives. Is it pure folly or a creative need
to improve upon the mistakes of others? Most recent remakes seem to be
financial quests for more $$$, cashing in on the known product and its
glowing reputation. Whatever the reason, all are hoping the film will
be rediscovered by a new audience and make a profitable return.Which brings us to the latest entry, Disney&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast
(2017). Now the studio has pulled from its vaults one of the most
honored movies of all times, a near-perfect masterwork and the only
animated film ever to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. (Perhaps
we should drop to our knees and give thanks that they do not own the
rights to Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, Some Like It Hot, or many other
film classics.) Beauty and the Beast (1991) has such a high pedigree and creates a
daunting challenge to covert into a live action remake, even with all
of the CGI state-of-the-art technology and artisans on board for this
project.Which leaves us to wonder: Can one ever perfect the already
perfect...Is there room for improvement upon such a skillful work of
art? Director Bill Condon was at the helm of this project and the
answer to his end result is decidedly a mixed blessing.Let me begin by saying that is much to admire in this re-imagining. Yet
for every step forward, the film awkwardly takes two steps back: the
nice mix of live action and CGI is more than serviceable yet hardly
magical, the ensemble is well cast with some notable exceptions,
production values are generally strong although proportions of the
re-animated animated objects are inconsistent and vary in size from one
scene to the next, and the glorious score by the talented team of Alan
Menken and the late Howard Ashman remains relatively intact, with some
additional new tunes added which do little to impress. (Except for one
standard Broadway 11 o&#x27;clock number, Evermore, the additional tunes
with lyrics by Tim Rice, are lackluster.)Also, on the minus side: Backstories have been written for some of the
characters, but they serve more as filler and do little to advance the
plot. The screenplay by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spilotopoulos has the
basic plot handled successfully, but too many sub-plots muck up the
works. The dialog has an overabundance of anachronisms than become
almost as jarring in their dated pop culture references as Josh Gad&#x27;s
odd interpretation in the role of a minor sidekick character, La Fou,
which becomes a major misstep in such a sweet story. The actor chooses
to perpetuate the gay effeminate stereotype in his overt &#x22;nance&#x22;
mannerisms that is humorless and borderline offensive. He almost ruins
the film as he takes this fairy tale far too literally and
figuratively, as does Bill Condon&#x27;s direction. His direction seems haphazard and in need of restraint. Mr. Condon
often goes for the obvious slapstick and crass moments rather than
enhancing the subtle charm and class of this classic love story. No
more is this apparent than in his treatment of the film&#x27;s big
production number, Be Our Guest. (In the original animated version, the
film is aglow with vibrant colors and stunning hand-drawn details that
make for a delightful movie-going experience. Here, the moment is
excessive, becoming a dizzying whirl of garish shapes and hyper-active
movement that blurs the details of its imagery. Other musical sequences
lack proper staging with scenes that overwhelm the proceedings.
However, Mr. Condon does get the essential title number right in both
setting a romantic mood and filling the screen with sumptuous
detailing.Some of the actors are spot-on, while other are just spotty. Emma
Watson as Belle, is fine in her acting, but her singing is wispy and
thin. (Paging Marni Nixon!) Ms. Watson does share a lovely chemistry
with Dan Steven&#x27;s Beast and the actor is very convincing in his angst
under layers of make-up and special effects. Kevin Kline as Belle&#x27;s
father is a treat as is Luke Evans, playing a leaner and meaner Gaston.
He captures the menace and vanity of this perfect foil. More
voice-overs than real supporting turns are provided by Emma Thompson,
Ewan McGregor, and Ian McKellen, while Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Stanley Lucci,
and Audra McDonald try to bring some degree of interest into their
fussy characterizations. And let&#x27;s not even discuss the mincing of the
aforementioned Mr. Gads any further...awful.That said, Beauty and the Beast (2017) still entertains and is a lovely
diversion in its tale of unconditional love. The celebrated music score
is a lovely homage to the Broadway musicals of yore and its romantic
story still enchants. I suppose, if one has never seen the superior
1991 film, I&#x27;m sure that what is on screen is all the more captivating.Russia said, &#x22;Nyet&#x22; to this remake due to censorship issues with
homophobia. I said, &#x22;Meh&#x22; to this remake due to purely aesthetic
reasons. This film, while no beast, is certainly no beauty either.
Rent, or better yet, buy the original animated version and bask in its
rare beauty. Sometimes tales as old as time really are...to say the
least.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>How did they NOT make this the best film ever?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Loved the animated version; in fact, would be in my top 25. Loved the
stage version.But then this live-action film happened. Disappointing. Cloogy. Forced
emotion in parts. I&#x27;m supposed to accept the love blossoming between
these two... and I did in the animated version; couldn&#x27;t in this one...
but to be honest, it choked me up anyway (though the tears started even
prior to the moments, so I&#x27;m thinking I was working from the remembered
story.)But perhaps the most damaging... besides the forced plot points and
emotion, was the horrific computer graphics on the Beast. With all the
great graphics in other films, why did they settle for this?Agree with others, should have been another director, perhaps other
screenwriters (or just lift the animated version verbatim). It&#x27;s not a
waste of time... so I give it a 7. But watch the animated version if
you have a choice. I&#x27;ll need to do just that to get back my fondness
for the story.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The whole package of everything we loved, except &#x27;the love&#x27; itself<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The opening scenes of Beauty and the Beast are very hard to watch. This
film is such an accurate blow by blow mimic of the 1991 Oscar winner
that it even nails the timing between lines. Unfortunately this is a
live movie with real actors, and actors need timing to give convincing
performances. there is no timing here. The movie goes from one beat to
another in spectacular fashion, and never catches its breath until
halfway through the picture.The highlight is the art direction. Beauty and the beast takes the
gilded, spiralling and flowered motifs of Roccoco to the extreme, and
the beast&#x27;s castle looks like a big gold/brass jungle. The negative is
that in order to see all this in full glory, director Bill Condon pulls
his camera back so far that it becomes pretty obvious that we are in a
sound stage.Emma Watson has all the beauty of Belle, but not enough of the
charisma. She is small, composed and vulnerable, and strangely
unimpressionable. During the Be Our Guest number, she stares at the
spectacle as if she on her forty fifth take and in need of a coffee.
Her singing voice is fine, but she underplays her numbers.How much credit to give Dan Stevens for his performance of the Beast,
I&#x27;m not sure. Together with the painters/animators of his face, he does
bring some humanity but not a great deal of character. As for the other
inhabitants of the castle, The CGI bring Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs.
Potts to life impeccably, but makes the mistake of minimizing their
facial features, thus rendering out their character. What we get are
not humans cursed with the form of house ware, we get house ware that
talks and moves.The best part of the movie is the middle act; between the second wolves
attack and the iconic Beauty and the Beast dance scene. Condon tries to
play cupid and get Belle and the Beast to fall in love. The script
helps him by giving him some admirable new material to work with, but
he cuts his these contemplative scenes too short. As a music number
Beauty and the Beast succeeds in summoning a bit of warm and fuzzy
nostalgia. This is the only song which comes close to making you feel
like you were watching the material for the first time. Whats missing
is the chemistry.Condon stages a chaotic rendition of the fight between Gaston&#x27;s mob and
the Beast&#x27;s army of house furniture, leading to Gaston and Beast coming
face to face. Condon falls short here too by not giving them much of a
fight. He also rushes the final spectacle of the movie where the beast
is turned back into a prince. Belle watches and doesn&#x27;t even flinch.
She takes one looks at him and inherently seems to know what is going
on, then they lock lips. The transformation of all the others (back
into humans) is done with a bit more flair, not to mention humour.Minus the muscles and singing voice, Luke Evans makes for a realistic
Gaston, but it is his side kick &#x27;gay&#x27; LeFou who hogs the spotlight.
More than any individual, the imagery itself is the real star of the
show, and there is too much of it. the scenery is over lit, it goes on
forever and the camera never stays still. There is enough spectacle
that you become almost numb to it. Beauty and the Beast leaves you feeling depressed for all the people
who Disney is cheating out of they&#x27;re money. the movie itself feels
like merchandise in a Disney store. It&#x27;s a superficially enjoyable
carbon copy of something real.

***Some/Littles Spoilers*** &#x22;She warned him not to be deceived by
appearances, for beauty is found within.&#x22; The legacy story that has
been told for ages turned into a modern up-to-date tale. The new
live-action remake of the classic 1991 animated musical of Beauty and
The Beast with Belle played by Emma Watson and the Beast played by Dan
Stevens. The movie tells a tale of two bookworms falling in love with a
help from household items.Watson brings the once nostalgic Bella to a new bright strong-willed
personality. Everybody remembers Watson when she starred as Hermione in
the Harry Potter series the similarities that the characters have are
their love for books and strive for knowledge.During the new prologue Steven who played the Beast is a young handsome
party loving prince unfortunately ignorance drove him to turn away an
old woman, she cast a curse upon him. Through a magical journey he
finds love. At the end of the movie, Belle cried when the Beast died
the enchantress reversed the curse to transformation the Beast to a
young smooth-skinned human with a maiden like physic.Even with the two main characters it is just as much about the
supporting characters as well. Lumiere and Cogsworth with their
friendship. Mrs. Potts is a comforting parent and her boy Chip is as
ever a lovable child. Gaston always being full of himself and LeFou the
sidekick of Gaston.The classic animated musical was now turned into a modernized
live-action piece of work that now every child and adult fans can enjoy
with laughter and excitement.I will have to rate this 9 out of 10

Well, I&#x27;m almost 60, knew the story line since I was 6, have seen every
version and this one really did blow me away with it&#x27;s stunning
visuals. Unlike transformers where I got so much input, I went to
sleep, Disney had me wanting more. I know I&#x27;m old school because the
tainted part of the movie for my wife and I was the two scenes where
the &#x22;left wing globalists&#x22; stick in the the gay guys and the cross
dresser. It blatantly detracted from the story line. It&#x27;s almost
obligatory these days, but I didn&#x27;t expect it from a classic. When it
elicited laughs from the audience instead of moans, it confirmed for me
the ongoing degradation and desensitization of society. I&#x27;m not
homophobic or intolerant, I&#x27;m moral. Our kids completely missed it
which was the saddest thing about the whole experience. Token gays are
a fact of life and so I guess I have to get with the program.... or
leave the planet.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I Think I&#x27;m Obsessed With This Movie...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
To start off, I absolutely loved the original 1991 film and admired
Belle as a character ever since I was a young child. But the original
did have multiple plot holes such as the age of Prince Adam when the
enchantress put the curse on him and his servants. But in this remake
this plot hole is fixed by showing the Prince as an adult when the
enchantress showed up at his palace and by changing the lyrics in &#x22;Be
our guest&#x22; from &#x22;ten years we&#x27;ve been rusting&#x22; to &#x22;to long we&#x27;ve been
rusting.&#x22; Not to mention the fact that the last rose petal was set to
fall on the prince&#x27;s 21st birthday in the 1991 film. This was changed
by simply not giving the final rose petal a known due date. I also believe that Emma Watson made a good Belle because she is the
closest thing to a human Belle. She did the role well and didn&#x27;t seem
out of character at any time. Even though she didn&#x27;t really sound all
that close to the animated Belle in her singing parts it&#x27;s not
necessarily a big deal. The rest of the casting in this movie was great
as well and the props and sets in the film were grand and magical as
well. My favorite performance in this movie was probably Josh Gad as
Lefou, he truly brought his character to life and the Gaston song in
the bar was just so amazing to watch! It was definitely a magical film
for me.So in conclusion, I honestly can&#x27;t wait till this movie gets on DVD and
blu-ray because I will continue to watch it over and over and over
again. I highly recommend it to Disney fans, non Disney fans and people
who just want to watch a charming movie.Thank you for reading my review!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not a bad adaptation<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It has to be said, Disney&#x27;s live action adaptations of their classic
animations haven&#x27;t really worked, &#x27;The Jungle Book&#x27; was horrendous and
the less said about the diabolical reworking of &#x27;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&#x27; the
better. However, they&#x27;ve finally managed to redeem themselves with the
newly released &#x27;Beauty And The Beast&#x27;. Apart from a few niggles, I
thought it was very good. It is easily the closest adaptation, and is
extremely faithful to the award winning 1991 animated film. Emma Watson
was magnificent as Belle and her singing voice was wonderful (I
understand she actually had some singing lessons from the original
Belle, Paige O&#x27;Hara). It is difficult to comment on Dan Stevens
portrayal of the Beast as so much was CGI, but he was suitably well
cast as the handsome Prince when he was visible on screen. Lumiere the
candelabra and Cogsworth the clock were voiced by Ewan McGregor and Sir
Ian McKellen respectively, and as much as I loved Ewan&#x27;s singing in
&#x27;Moulin Rouge&#x27;, he was hindered in this role by the awful French accent
he had to put on, which I found wavered on and off occasionally. The
teapot Mrs Potts, so perfectly voiced by Angela Lansbury in the
original, was portrayed by Emma Thompson, who I thought sounded like
she was trying to impersonate Angela instead of putting her own touch
to the character. Luke Evans stars as Gaston and in the classic
animation, Gaston was just a self-obsessed, arrogant, simple minded
villain, who&#x27;s determination to be looked on as &#x22;the best&#x22; and marry
Belle, drives him to fight the Beast out of jealousy, and was actually
depicted as a comedic character, but in this movie he is far darker
and, although retaining his narcissistic and self-centred traits, he is
much nastier and the comedic stupidity and arrogance from the original
is replaced with a far more manipulative and violent persona. The fight
between Gaston and the Beast differs too, from a simple battle of
strength and wits culminating in Gaston stabbing the Beast before
falling to his death in the animated movie, to Gaston actually shooting
the Beast a few times before eventually falling to his death. Now,
those who know me know, I don&#x27;t like change for change sake and was
very disappointed at a number of other changes too. The musical
numbers, added lyrics to the original numbers, added scenes (especially
the scene explaining the reason Belle&#x27;s mother isn&#x27;t there, which was
pretty pointless as far as I could tell). All the classic well known
songs from the original are here, but as I mentioned there are added
lyrics to some, and the lyrics in the song &#x27;Gaston&#x27; were, at times,
almost inaudible. I do understand that sometimes songs are added for
timing reasons, but there is a stunning and award winning stage
production of &#x27;Beauty and The Beast&#x27; which has added songs in it, so I
couldn&#x27;t understand why they had to write brand new songs for this
movie rather than just add a couple from the stage production,
especially the Beast&#x27;s number &#x27;If I Can&#x27;t Love Her&#x27;, which, in my
opinion, would have fitted better than the number he sings in this
movie &#x27;Evermore&#x27;. Despite the few disappointments, I do have to say
that it is a stunning movie, very well made with some excellent
performances and doesn&#x27;t stray too far from the Oscar winning original
we all know and love. Worth seeing for sure.

Reading all the negative reviews citing the &#x27;distracting&#x27; CGI, Emma
Watson not being as good as the animated Belle(!), etc., etc. I wonder
what people expect when going to movies like this. Do they leave their
sense of wonder at home and just look to pick holes? Well, to summarise
my feelings on seeing Beauty and the Beast - I thought it was lovely!
It paid respectful homage to the iconic animated original, but can
stand on its own two feet as an artistic achievement. The
cinematography and set decoration was magnificent, Emma Watson was
fresh-faced and feisty as Belle, Luke Evans was a funny and wonderfully
hateful Gaston and the musical numbers were well staged (Emma has a
sweet voice which suits the songs). Only down side was that we didn&#x27;t
get to see very much of Dan Stevens out of beast mode - but can&#x27;t help
the story-line! I thought that the beast CGI was effective and managed
to convey both the savage and vulnerable sides of the character. Go and
see it, take your movie critic hat off and prepare to lose yourself in
this magical movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty and the Beast Review<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It&#x27;s a tale as old as time and a song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the
Beast. The original Disney animated movie was the first animated movie
to ever be nominated for the Best Picture category at the Academy
Awards, back in 1991. So it&#x27;s no wonder that there was a lot of
pressure to get the live-action version just right. It&#x27;s easy to
compare it to the animated movie, but the live-action version brings a
lot of new elements to the story. It provides backstory for several
characters as well as better romantic development between Belle and the
Beast. That&#x27;s all accompanied by some great and often delightful acting
performances as well as the musical songs.While the movie is basically a remake of the animated version it also
changes a few things and adds in scenes in order to tell the story
better. One new element the movies adds comes from the original fairy
tale story, and that&#x27;s Belle asking for a rose every year from her
father Maurice. The movie also adds in new scenes between Belle and the
beast that creates a better romantic connection between the two. Emma
Watson does a great job playing Belle, she brings a lot the character
beyond being warm and kind. Dan Stevens also does a good job at making
the beast sympathetic as well as caring. As for the songs. While Emma Watson does not sound like Paige O&#x27;Hara
(the voice of Belle in the cartoon) she does a wonderful job singing
the songs. Surprisingly Dan Stevens has a great singing voice and gets
an original song that is actually really good. Even though Ewan
McGregor&#x27;s French accent was not great, his version of Be Our Guest was
fantastic and different from the original. Emma Thompson does a
wonderful job as Mrs. Potts. While not copying Angela Lansbury, she
still brings warmth and care to the character. Not everything in the movie was perfect. Luke Evans is a great actor
but his version of Gaston is not as fun as he was in the cartoon. This
is evident in the song &#x22;Gaston&#x22;. Josh Gad does a great job as LaFou,
who is not quite the fool he was in the animated movie, but Gad has a
great singing voice. The other thing that was quite as well done is the
ballroom scene with the title song. The visuals didn&#x27;t feel as grand
and magical despite the setting. Some of the directing were off in a
few scenes, where the focus wasn&#x27;t clear and the angles weren&#x27;t
perfect. Some of the designs for the object characters were odd
looking, but after a while, you get used to it. However, if we stop comparing this to the animated version, this movie
is a great adaptation that has a lot to add to the story. The opening
musical &#x22;Belle&#x22; draws the audience right into the character and the
town. It sets up the story perfectly and does a great job establishing
why Belle doesn&#x27;t fit in with the town. The ending had some small
changes that were surprising and interesting. Overall this movie was
beautiful, sweet and magical, everything you want in a Disney fairy
tale movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A visually mesmerizing movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First and foremost, this movie is visually stunning. From the beginning
to the end. Disney has done an amazing job of keeping everything seem
so alive, and alarmingly terrifying at times.This is a story about Belle, who is a well read town girl and wants
something more than &#x22;this provincial life&#x22;. She eventually steps into
Beast, who is a prince cursed by an enchantress. He has time to reverse
himself until the last petal of an enchanted rose falls. In the
meanwhile, Belle is continuously wooed by all-brawn-and-no-brain
Gaston, who has an evil intention of killing the Beast and forcibly
marrying Belle. Love is slowly blossoming between Belle and the Beast,
but will it be enough to break the curse?All the characters in the story have blended nicely with an amazing
cast. As I have said before, the visuals were stunning, and so were the
ballads performed throughout the musical. A 3D experience is
phenomenal, and kind of required.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It was only bad if you liked the first Disney version. Great if you hated it<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
If you liked the first Disney movie perhaps this movie is not for you.
I fell asleep during the first.I am a major fairy tale geek and what I
wanted was to be swept away by the enchanted castle. I was. I would
have stayed there with him looking ugly for a great library, no noise
and a wonderful partner. The servants were great talking inanimate
objects who were calm and pleasant. In fact the real prince was kind of
wimpy. It would have been harder to live with him. The actors were all
good, especially Kevin Kline and the songs were quite fine if you like
that sort of thing. But if like me you wanted a breath taking castle
which is why you went to the movie - if you liked the French version of
Beauty and the Beast and hated Disney, this may be your movie.

Disney&#x27;s live action remake of Cinderella set the box office tills on
fire in 2015, so it was inevitable they would mine deeper into their
archive of former glories for another hit.This mostly shot for shot remake of 1991&#x27;s Best Picture Oscar nominated
classic is less wooden and more lovingly handled, although with 45 mins
of extra running time, the padding is sometimes painfully obvious.Emma Watson proves to be a charming Belle, far more accomplished in
this non-Harry Potter outing than her previous ones (and is not
hampered by a death knell American accent, cf The Bling Ring) and is
matched by a hugely enjoyable Luke Evans as her preening suitor Gaston.

Adapting the animated classical musical into a live action musical
brought forth some memorable emotional moments but at the same time
lost the fun exaggerated, lightness captured in the cartoonish display
of several of the characters. The most prominent problem with the
updated live action movie is the casting of the real human character
Gaston whose physical presence just doesn&#x27;t capture the animated
comical snootiness of the anti-hero. The animated version had charm
whereas the live action version had to make due with a pseudo-Broadway
stage musical production and in some ways didn&#x27;t capture the dazzling
set designs along with the musical renditions found in such productions
as Sound of Music or even Mary Poppins or My Fair Lady.The live action was most wonderful when it came to the humanity of
human suffering and pain but as the same time became too edgy in its
raw, violent scenes. Oddly enough Kevin Kline while perfectly cast as
the father, wasn&#x27;t Kevin Kline enough to capture the softer and lightly
comical animated version. As for the use of song as live actions and
the voice over, which is almost second nature in animated movies, since
Les Miserable (2012) use of live singing on set, this live action
musical seemed less authentic and more acted.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It&#x27;s actually just good (impartial review)<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First of all, I&#x27;m writing this because there needs to be an impartial
review. I see people saying it&#x27;s perfect and people saying is garbage
which is neither.Now, for people saying it is boring and a waste of time because is the
same as the animated. This is a REMAKE, what were you expecting? and
also it is not exactly the same as the cartoon, there are subtle
differences that actually make sense like: 1. we get more explanation
to how the curse works with the explanation to why the village people
don&#x27;t remember the castle or the people in it. 2. we also get backstory
of both the Beast and Belle 3. Belle is now the inventor which is
actually cool and if you are not OK with that, I mean is 2017 like you
and your bigotry mind should go live in that provincial town 3. The new
songs are really good and worked perfectly, in my opinion 4. Le Fou is
now canonically gay which is neither good or bad, actually I always
assume he already was. Although 2 seconds of him dancing with another
guy is not that much of a big &#x22;gay moment&#x22; for it to make headlines an
polemic, but that&#x27;s for another rant.And for people giving this a ten, I have to agree that it is not THAT
good: Some of the CGI is pretty average and over used in some points I
also have to say that it lacks some of the charm from the original
because the characters feel a little flat sometimes plus I could
actually live without the new piano guy, that new addition was just mehOverall I give it a 7 because it has some little flaws but it is a very
good and a pretty solid retake on a beautiful story that we will always
love
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Memorable Disney remake<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
No sense of me telling the plot, because it has been told so many times
through the years, this film is basically a remake of the 1991 animated
Disney film, although I never really watched it. This film is for kids
and adults, they through in some adult jokes that would probably go
over the kids head. It not always light, it also shows it&#x27;s dark in
spots.The effects are pretty good here to the point where it becomes the
whole movie in spots. Emma Watson is great has the tough minded Bella,
Dan Stevens really brings it has the beast. Luke Evans is so good at
being hateful, and I was bit disappointed on his characters demise, he
was so unlikable, I felt his character should have gotten a bigger
justice then what I saw. And why is Josh Gad even in this, he is so out
of place here, now I often find Josh Gad funny and entertaining, but
his character seems to belong in another movie. But other then that it
was a pretty entertaining film, enjoyable for the whole family. Lets
not forget a memorable supporting role by Kevin Kline.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A beautiful remake with spectacular wardrobe<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I definitely see why this recent remake generated so much in box office
sales. I was less than 4 years old when the original Disney animated
movie Beauty and the Beast came out and now parents in my generations
are seeing it with their kids. The adults that are the most nostalgic
have a gorgeous wardrobe remake of their own; see it here:www.ofleatherandlace.com/ reimagining-fairy-tales-beauty-and-the-beast/
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An Excellent Addition to the Story<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I understand there are many people that will hate this movie because it
has Emma Watson in it. I also think that to hate this movie for that
reason is unjust and frankly stupid.Yes, Emma Watson deserves criticism for some (OK, maybe a lot) of her
acting in the Harry Potter series. She reminds me of Joey in Friends
when he was playing Dr Drake Ramoray and explained the &#x27;Smell the fart&#x27;
acting when he couldn&#x27;t remember his lines! Some of her pauses in Harry
Potter are exactly like that!Anyway, back the movie in hand. There are some major plot holes in the
1991 cartoon, and every single one is addressed in this movie, giving
it depth, background and originality. There is one story and you can
only tell it so many ways, so for all the people who expect something
original, I have one message: &#x27;Go watch something else&#x27;.The CGI graphics are excellent, the colours and scenery are extremely
well done and the movie as a whole looks impressive. With the extra
scenes and explanations, the movie gives a more satisfactory story
(even when you didn&#x27;t realise you needed one after the 1991 version)
including the castle no one misses, the significance of the library
gift and the fact that none of the castle characters are ever missed
from the local village.I took my 9 year old to see this and she loved it. The wolf scenes
could be scary for younger viewers (mine couldn&#x27;t watch!) but she
laughed and cheered all the way through. An excellent evening spent and
one I would repeat given a chance.Others may concentrate on originality (originality in a remake?!),
slight CGI deficiencies in certain places (please!) or the fact that
Emma Watson is in the movie, but don&#x27;t listen to them. The Beast looks
great, the wolves are a 2 minute segment and Emma Watson, although not
the most beautiful woman in the World, has similar features to the
cartoon version and more than holds her own in the role (even managing
to lose the dramatic &#x27;smell the fart&#x27; pauses).An enjoyable evening out for those with kids and for us kids at heart.

Chances are you will like this one too. As a fan of the original I was nervous they were going to go way
overboard and make it a shell of the animated version, however they
showed a lot of restraint in most of the changes, and to be honest the
additions were actually improvements. Ever wonder why the villagers have no idea there is a castle within
eyesight? If the villagers actually like Gaston? What happened to
Belle&#x27;s mother? What Belle and the Beast actually had in common? This
film answered all those questions.Some reviews mention the CGI is distracting but I didn&#x27;t find that, it
actually greatly enhanced some of the more visual scenes like &#x27;Be Our
Guest&#x27; which was great in the original but even better in this version. The major flaw in this film is Emma Watson. Her facial expressions are
often out of sync with what is actually happening in the plot, and the
extraordinary tendencies and personality referred to by the other
characters are more heard than seen. Les Miserables also made the same
mistake by casting someone who couldn&#x27;t sing in a musical and let them
get way overshadowed by the people who could sing. Other than that it was 20 minutes too long, but most movies are.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A fair fairy-tale with mass appeal<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Would you love a monster?&#x22;, has become an increasingly moot question
in our age branded by individualism and non-conformist viewpoint, so
the answer would be: you betcha! How cool can be to tame a beast like
that? Not to mention, his monstrous front aside, there nestling a
genuine prince inside, that&#x27;s a bonus!This Disney live-action revamp of the classic fairy-tale, directed by
the workmanlike Bill Condon (DREAMGIRLS 2006 and TWILIGHT franchise,
with occasional curve-ball GODS AND MONSTERS 1998), clings firmly to
its 1991 animation in its storyboard and iconic songs, rendered
altogether with a grandiose flourish could run rings around Kenneth
Branagh&#x27;s Cinderella (2015).The preamble musters efficiency and glimpses of royal pageantry with a
more plausible premise (in the realm of magic, sky is the limit), a
selfish prince (Steven) is transformed into a monster (and his servants
into a clutter of objects) by an enchantress (Morahan), he must learn
to truly love someone and get the reciprocal affection before time is
running out, otherwise, him along with his hapless underlings will lose
humanity for keeps. Then the narrative introduces our heroine Belle
(Watson), a French village girl, who has a yen for reading and is an
inventor herself (both are inadvisable hobbyhorses for womenfolk
strait-jacketed by macho insularity), she is relentlessly pursued by
Gaston (Evans), a bumptious village war-hero who doesn&#x27;t take no for an
answer. When Belle&#x27;s father Maurice (Kline) is interned in the
monster&#x27;s castle for stealing a rose (a gift under Belle&#x27;s request),
Belle trades herself for her father, and inevitably develops a quasi-
Stockholm syndrome to her captor (with the benevolent prodding from
those anthropomorphic knick-knacks, among which a motormouth Ewan
McGregor revels in sporting a wavering French accent as a candelabra).
But when an exasperated Gaston knows about the existence of the
monster, he convenes the village mob to assail the castle, there will
only be one man standing between him and the monster, Belle is
entangled in the scramble, but her feels powerless to stop the
inevitable, until, yes, the magic moment after a poignant
humanity-dissipating corollary. What a volatile enchantress! The upgraded musical numbers are meat and potatoes to the allure of the
film, highlights are BE OUR GUEST (a cynosure garnished with the most
deliriously enchanting special effects), GASTON (Evans is so close to
snag that Hollywood leading man status for a voluntarily outed gay
actor) and Emma Thompson&#x27;s rendition of the theme song, a balm to one&#x27;s
ears, it is beggar belief that she hasn&#x27;t been cast in a musical
before!Acting wise, the film is a bog-standard family friendly fare demands
nothing taxing for its stellar cast, Watson is presentable but far from
impressive, Stevens is understandably curbed by his overwhelming
costume, even his voice is muffled as if emanated from a mask, only
Josh Gad&#x27;s LeFou adds a nice (but overtly praised) touch of gay
inclusivity.Disney&#x27;s gargantuan ambition of transposing their animation repertoire
into live-action by virtue of technique advancement, has been in full
swing and proved to be not only viable but also massively lucrative,
the only gripe is they could be more gallant in its story-telling
(different angles, re- interpretation, reflecting current perspective,
et al.), but at the same time, one cannot help but wondering does this
trend flag up an overlooking threat to the popularity of animation
filmmaking, a food for thought - when CGI anthropomorphism can
seamlessly meet the demands, what will audience (in particular,
grownups) prefer, a more realistic context or a self-conscious
other-worldly dimension?
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have to admit, I have never watched the animated movie. When Disney
said they were making a live action version with Emma Watson and Dan
Stevens, I was on board. I don&#x27;t know really why I&#x27;ve never watched the
animated version but watching this movie was a great experience.I just can&#x27;t get that song out of my head. I was humming it after the
movie was over and all the way to my home. I am playing that song on a
loop right now. The movie was great, Emma Watson was awesome and the beast was really
good. Every voice actors from Emma Thompson to Ian McKellen were good.
The way this movie is made, it will appeal to all the demography...old
and young.Even though you know what is coming next, you are still attentive. The
actors and the production have that hold on you. The sets were huge and
the production design was top notch.I loved it. It was a fun Saturday!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The good and the bad<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
To be more precise my rating is a 6.5 but thought I&#x27;d round it up to a
7. Well this has been a Disney remake that I, along with what I am sure
is many other people, anticipated for a very long time. I didn&#x27;t expect
too much, though: no one could top Angela Lansbury&#x27;s rendition of
Beauty and the Beast. And Emma Watson, though she does have the beauty
that is similar to Belle&#x27;s, lacks almost everything else that made
Belle the way she was. I&#x27;ll start off with a list of what I believe was bad, then end this
review on a good note. These are of course my opinions and are to be
taken with a grain of salt! (Possible spoilers ahead). The Bad: 1. Emma
Watson&#x27;s singing voice. I was informed before going into the cinema
that her voice was autotuned, but man this was autotuned to the MAX!
Some parts almost sounded a bit too robotic for my liking. 2. Ewan
McGregor. I respect him and do believe he is a fine actor, but he put
on the worst French accent I have heard. Though, his rendition of &#x22;Be
Our Guest&#x22; compensated for it. 3. When Beast transformed back into his
human self, I would have very much preferred Dan Steven&#x27;s actual look
than try and copy the cartoon&#x27;s human interpretation of the beast. 4.
The ending felt a bit too abrupt. One moment they were kissing, then
all of a sudden they were in a ballroom and everything was completely
fine. I understand that this probably had to do with pacing issues but
I do believe there was just some small transitional scene. 5. The
beast&#x27;s solo was a bit boring and not very effective. Dan Stevens has a
nice voice but I felt that it didn&#x27;t give as much of a punch as I had
anticipated. The good: 1. The visuals were absolutely stunning! I loved the cold
winter-y setting used in the castle. Absolutely gorgeous and gives a
very gloomy feel at the same time. The scene where Belle runs up the
hills as her Reprise reaches its climax was just as breathtaking in my
opinion. 2. I&#x27;m not trying to get political here but I liked the fact
that they had some dark skinned actors and actresses instead of just
all white like they did in the original cartoon. 3. It was great to see
the prologue have a more in depth story which explains some of the plot
holes present in the original film. I won&#x27;t go too in depth and let the
viewer find that out. 4. Emma Thompson did a very good job on &#x22;Beauty
and the Beast&#x22;, though my previous statement still stands that no one
could top Angela Lansbury&#x27;s rendition of it. 5. Be Our Guest was such a
delight to look at! The visuals, the choreography, the singing! It was
like watching a fireworks display. 6. I really liked Le Fou&#x27;s character
development in &#x22;The Mob Song&#x22;. They gave him much more depth than they
did in the original. I&#x27;m not just talking about the fact that they made
him a homosexual, but I liked how they didn&#x27;t make him a delusional,
devoted idiot. He knew what was right from wrong. 7. The humour was
effective. Then again I am easily entertained so I won&#x27;t go too in
depth with this point. So all in all, it was a pretty good attempt. The visuals were stunning
and most of the music was a delight to listen to, but I do believe that
the original will always be the better one. I am no film critic, just a
simple movie watcher, so like I said before: take all this with a grain
of salt!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Amazing, and a lot to take in at the same time<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Oh, where do i start? First the set design, based during the Roccoco/
Art Nouveau period, was spectacular. All the intricate details were so
well done. Very refined and very on point decor of every set. Second
the acting was so well done. From Emma Watson down to the ordinary
villager, everyone looked like they were so much into there roles and
had a lot of fun during each performance. Third, the Song &#x22;Be Our
Guest&#x22;. This was that one song i was so looking forward to and the song
was so overwhelming i needed about ten minutes to get over it and
switch back to concentrating on the movie again (lol!). Lastly, the
ball dance. God the ball dance!! so well shot and loved Emma Thompson&#x27;s
version as well as Ariana Grande and John Legends. Belles dress, that
some people found distasteful, GUYS!! learn to let go of trying to see
how close it was to the animated version of the dress, the dress was
amazing and is still amazing in this movie. Recommending this movie to
everyone, but also the die hard fans, go and watch it right now... and
please stop trying to see how its different to the 1991 version on a
microscopic level, move on and appreciate this masterpiece of a movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A must see!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
To the children of 90s, I think, this movie brings back a torrent of
memories from the past; especially all those weekends spent in front of
the TV watching Belle turning the Beast into a prince charming. The
scenes in the movie were too good and too cartoonish to be real! yet it
was. What you saw in the cartoon is exactly reproduced in the movie;
the scenes, the songs, the clothes ... though the childhood stories of
Belle and the beast is added to the movie as a subgenre; you could also
see people of different colors and even of sexuality, there is a fast
scene of a gay couple dancing. Regarding the performances, I have to
say, Dan Stevens, the beast, played wonderfully as did Emma Watson. The
cast in general play and perform in such a harmony that they offer you
a dream- like world; this colorful movie can offer you a two hour of
joy and reminiscence whether you watch it once or a hundreds of times.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great conversion of the original. Emma Watson a bit out of place.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Watched this one yesterday and in my opinion, it came off way better
than the modern jungle book remake. The CGI animation is much better
suited to this story while keeping the essence intact. The movie didn&#x27;t
always carry the right momentum and the new songs were a bit hit and
miss, but that sits in line with the original songs which were fun and
memorable but half the time a bit sing-what-you-could-
just-say-or-are-doing, but perfectly passable relative to its
predecessor.The main thing that let the movie down for me was Emma Watson. I don&#x27;t
think she&#x27;s a bad actress or have anything personal against her, but
most the time her sort of face squint she does isn&#x27;t what we want to
see. She tries to hard to act, sometimes this works in strong emotional
scenes, but most the time she&#x27;s supposed to represent an innocence she
just doesn&#x27;t seem to have. The last foible is that at times her
interaction with all-CG elements including The Beast, look awkward and
displaced. Mostly this isn&#x27;t the case, but sometimes it is and it is
off-putting. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s all her fault: it could be down to
direction that things are left wrong...Despite the issues I have with Belle, she still carries the story
perfectly well and the film is just as enjoyable as the older Disney
animation. Excellent use of our current age of technology and the songs
still feel right at home.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Wonderful rendition!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I thought it was a really good version of Disney&#x27;s Beauty and the
Beast. I will be buying it for my video library. I laughed, I cried,
and returned to my childhood in all the right places. Unless you are
watching it to find fault, you will enjoy it. Possible Spoiler Alert:
Yes, as all versions are, it is a musical; and no, (and I am happy
either way) I don&#x27;t think Emma really sang... I loved it!I gave it a 9 out of 10 because the singing voice that initially comes
from Emma is tonally different than her own and so a bit of a shock. I
got used to it, though.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I loved the movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I walked in to the theater to see beauty and the beast expecting a
little bit different from the story i grew up with but here&#x27;s what I
didn&#x27;t expect I didn&#x27;t expect to love it As much or more than the
original movie i was taping my toes in the theater to every song Sang
it was a good time and super fun at the movies and um the people who
are not seeing the movie due to the.supposed gay moment.please I beg of
you reconsider your decision and go see it I loved the lovely Emma
Watson as Bell and also the gay moment seemed to be more during the
Gaston song in my opinion yes lefo did dance with a man who is seemed
to be transgender but the Gaston song was more intense however I am
going to say that you should take the family to see the movie it&#x27;s
clearly not to be missed

Belle (Emma Watson) is a...yeah probably no need for a plot synopsis
since this is the tale as old as time and it would just bore the hell
out of any reader. So lets just get to it. &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is
the live action Disney remake that comes twenty six years after the
gorgeous animated feature.I am more not only fine, but encourage the retelling of classical tales
in any kind of medium. It has been done since the dawn of humanity and
I see no problem in doing so as long as there is always something new
to add to these stories and some fresh silver lining to find in our
characters. Going into this I must admit that I was very frighted to be
treated to a shot for shot remake that I would have enjoyed only
because of charm and would have felt embarrassed about it.Whilst there is treading of familiar grounds, I was so pleasantly
surprised to see what a great, touching and progressive modern take
Disney was able to stamp on it. I am a big fan of the animated feature,
the story is really universal and whilst this entry does not touch the
emotional heights and the charm of the original, it offers a reminder
of what a flawless piece of storytelling this is and it graces us with
a good enough touch that managed to take me genuinely to enjoy and live
this story one more time in a different way.Whilst the songs might be the same they are always so fantastically
entertaining on their own, Bill Condon builds on that and assembles a
series of flashy musical numbers that all live beautifully on screen.
There is no fast cutting, the editing decisions in these pieces are
always warranted and the filmmakers manage to strike a perfect balance
of seeing everything unfold on screen and using the editing to enhance
the music. There are also a couple on updated or new musical numbers
and it was a great sign that they flowed with the picture fluently,
they felt genuine and didn&#x27;t play as a forced new addition.Of course the real spearhead of this production is its incredible cast
and what can one say that the list of names here cannot already do on
its own. It is just pure glee, there isn&#x27;t one half of a bad casting
decision, everybody not only fits their role, but does the perfect
amount of updating and nuance to make you buy into them as soon as they
appear on screen. Luke Evans was definitely the highlight for me, he
brought Gaston to the screen in all of his ridiculousness and irony, it
was a pleasure to see and was the high point of comedy of an already
strongly funny film.Another magical strength of the film is its CGI. There are a couple of
green screens that got under my skin because of their blatant
notability, especially considering how excellent the rest of the VFX
were. This was really state of the art work. I literally could not tell
all of the animated characters were apart from the live action ones, it
was completely seamless in a way that I think we&#x27;ve never seen done
this good before. The question never came up, there was not a single
false beat, they were absolutely perfect.However, what might be the very best part of this update is just how
modern it is. No, not only because of a gay character, which still is
such a brilliant addition because of how brilliantly they manage to
weave it into the story and adapt it into a fairy tale character.
There&#x27;s much more here, many genre conventions are broken, many
male/female stereotypes are purposefully bent and turned on their
heads, there is diversity and it so beautiful to see such an iconic
story get an adaptation that is a better representation of the human
race.Yes, there is no denying some of the ground treaded is very familiar
and I am the first to say that there still is some space for change in
this story, there still are a couple of plot point that can be updated
and because of how modern the take overall is I felt like some events
and minor character dynamics could have had a little polishing.
Technically too the film has some moments of disjointed editing and it
could have done with a little more cutting. Don&#x27;t mistake me, the two
hours never drag, but they do feel kind of unnecessary by the end, a
five to ten minute tightening could have done the job.I was initially a little cold on this film, but after realizing just
how much I enjoyed it, how it actually got to me on an emotional level
by the end and how charmed I was by the characters and their new
iterations. I have to admit that I would be happily up to rewatching
the film which was something I was doubting going in. I bumped up the
score a little because of this, I hope that a further viewing confirms
my feelings on this.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A great remake that has personality<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
With the animated film being one of the most iconic films of all time
there was a lot of pressure on this film to be good and I thought it
really was. The premise of this film sees a girl who is seemed to be
weird by her village because of her books, when she is trapped in an
enchanted castle with a a beast. Emma Watson plays belle in this film
and she does a decent job, she fit the role with her looks and singing
voice. I also thought she was a pretty strong female character that is
good for women to see. However, I felt like her character was a little
bland and wooden which made her one of the least memorable characters
in this film. Dan Stevens plays the beast in this film and I thought he
did a great job, I thought his character had a good character arc in
the film and I liked his subtle humour that he had in the role. Luke
Evans plays Gaston in this film and he was absolutely the perfect
person to play this role, he had the look, the voice and the charisma
he had oozed on the screen. Josh gadd also had great comedic timing in
this film and I loved his chemistry with Evans in this film. Ewan
McGregor and ian McKellen play lemuier and cogsworth and they
encapsulated the roles perfectly and I loved them in these roles. The
story does have some truly emotional moments that makes you care about
the majority of characters. However, similar to how I felt about the
2014 Cinderella film this film doesn&#x27;t really add anything new to its
story which makes it an easy watch but doesn&#x27;t do anything that
interesting. The script has some great humour in it that really
surprised me and actually had me and the audience laughing quite a lot.
The drama also works and you end up buying the development in belle and
beasts relationship. The style of this film has some excellent singing
sequences that are very familiar but memorable in this film. Overall
this is a great remake that hopefully leads to more of these remakes.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The real risk was visual<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The Disney&#x27;s bet about creating the remake of such an epic story was
visionary and as it comes, risky. Its just predicable the huge amount
of critics from the classic fans. In my opinion the real goal of the
production is in visual terms, in fact, the visual effects sometimes
are just good enough, the real problem is that good enough isn&#x27;t enough
for the magnitude of this film. Specially in the village, for me its
such evident the chrome used that it seems intentional from the
director, make it look like a tale, three point over a simple
animation. The castle and the unreal characters works, it force you to
forget about picky unbelievable details of the village and push you in
the whole fantastic and magic story, where we can&#x27;t resists when we are
in front of such a splendorous tale. The perform of Emma Watson its not
far from the action range we all already know of her, but lets be
clear, what is the big difference between Bella and Hermione, they both
are perfect, pretty, intelligent, weirdo girls, the perfect essence for
Emma interpretation. Beast its a good Beast, I rescue the visual
effects and his look, it is just as good as it must have to be. In
other terms, the art, music and story development its satisfactory, I
enjoy this film, having clear from it begging the purpose of Disney and
that its not a master piece.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Has Its Shortcomings, But Is Still a Faithful Adaptation<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The overall look of this movie is fantastic. Everything from the
production design, to the costumes, to the character design is
flawless. Director Bill Condon did a masterful job working with all the
different departments in order to capture the look of the original
film. That may sound like an easy feat, but it really isn&#x27;t. Not only
did they have to capture the look of it, but they had to capture the
feel of it as well, which they did in spades! I was immediately whisked
away into the world of the animated film, which is a high compliment. I
think a lot of the technical aspects of the film are what really
shines. The CGI works, for the most part. I&#x27;ll talk about the Beast in
a minute, but I thought the CGI for Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and
all the other appliances were top-notch. Not only did they look great
on their own, but they blended well with the real world. Nothing stood
out as looking fake when they interacted with Belle, which is more than
I can say than with the Beast. But I&#x27;ll get into that later. The songs
were also perfectly recaptured. From the choreography to the
cinematography, these scenes were flawless. All the songs, from &#x22;Belle&#x22;
to &#x22;Gaston&#x22; to &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;, were excellently realized, and
effectively translated into live action. You can tell Condon put a lot
of time and care into making sure they worked, and he absolutely
succeeded in doing so...

A fabulous movie, I enjoyed every moment. So beautifully done that I
would watch it again. It&#x27;s a true musical as they used to be. I cried
and laughed, it brought out many emotions. It&#x27;s a great family film.
The artistry and special effects make a great Disney style fantasy come
to life. The music and songs were very pleasant in typical Disney
fashion.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not that bad actually<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I know, Disney producers should be ashamed of themselves for making yet
another remake instead of picking something more original. I entirely
agree with that. But, history aside, I&#x27;d say the film itself is
actually pretty good. OK, I was actually one of those boyfriends that
were dragged along to watch it, so my expectations were pretty low. But
still. The cinematography is spectacular. And Emma Whatson is entirely
convincing and enjoyable as Belle. So the film did not break any new
grounds, but if you want something feel-good for Friday night, then you
might actually enjoy it. (Although I don&#x27;t understand why every single
movie must include LGBT these days (with all due respect to the
community). It&#x27;s a fairy tale, for god&#x27;s sake.)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Very Fun<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I went in expecting good music, visual wonder, and a classic fairy tale
and that is exactly what I got. I particularly liked the period French
costumes. If you&#x27;re expecting originality, maybe don&#x27;t go see a re-
make. If you&#x27;re looking for a fun and nostalgic rendering of a classic
fairy tale, this is it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Middle Age Fat Guy Likes It.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
OK, so I&#x27;m a middle aged fat guy, former soldier and retired cop. Hard
ass never liked musicals in my life. I couldn&#x27;t stand &#x22;Oklahoma&#x22;, &#x22;West
Side Story&#x22;, &#x22;Guys and Dolls&#x22;, etc and I&#x27;m a HUGE classic movie buff.
Loved the ones NOT musicals and absolutely refused to give any Disney
musical even a chance at entertaining me. If it was guns, explosions,
hot chicks in Daisy Dukes, I was all for it. I loved the ones like
&#x22;Marty&#x22;, &#x22;On The Water Front&#x22;, &#x22;Casablanca&#x22;, etc. Still wasn&#x27;t going to
watch a musical.Then this movie came out and I saw the previews. I found myself
watching the previews every time I came to IMDb to write about some
subject. It slowly started creeping into my conscience. All I knew is
it had that little girl from the Harry Potter movies that my boys so
loved growing up.Then I heard her sing and it grabbed me by the heart. This last
Christmas I spent with the Moscow ballet and so I was already into
ballet and music. Just not musicals but her singing had me telling my
wife, &#x22;We&#x27;re going to see that when it comes out.&#x22; I&#x27;ve literally seen
thousands of movies in my life. I used to work at a cinema. I can tell
you the movies that I have actually paid to see at the theater more
than once: &#x22;Star Wars (original)&#x22;.... &#x22;Terminator&#x22;....&#x22;Spaceballs&#x22;...
&#x22;Unforgiven&#x22;.... &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;... &#x22;Saving Private Ryan&#x22;.....
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;. I don&#x27;t care about Oscar winning movies. I
watch them because if someone asks about them, I&#x27;ll actually know what
I&#x27;m talking about.I&#x27;m not gay but I watched &#x22;Brokeback Mountain&#x22; just so I could tell
people that they were full of bulls**** when they trashed it. People
never saw it and just drove it into the ground. When it came to BATB, I
heard people passively talking about it as, &#x22;Just another Disney
musical that we might take the kids to see.&#x22; 50 years old.. 250 lbs
retired soldier and police officer... Has testicles firmly in place..
Married... Kids are grown and living in the world... I look like a
cross between Tom Arnold and Alfred E. Newman..... and I not only paid
twice to see it, I&#x27;m going to take my wife and watch it a third time
tomorrow.I can tell you the CGI/Human interaction is incredibly detailed and
perfect. All of the characters bring energy to the story in their own
way. The casting was damn near as perfect as you can get in a movie of
this scale, requiring so much talent. The acting was believable, the
singing was encompassing and vibrated your heart. I kept waiting for a
&#x22;slow&#x22; part so I could run to the restroom. The movie never slowed down
a bit. It kept going right along, smooth transition from scene to
scene, the music keeping you involved. I was enthralled.Go see it. If you need a middle aged fat guy to go with you so people
don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re a creeper, call me. I&#x27;ve seen it alone and you
do get strange looks. But it&#x27;s worth the strange looks.I hope you do go see the movie and I hope that you enjoy it.Bill
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great movie. loved it!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Evenough I saw so many bad reviews on this movie, I think it&#x27;s AMAZING.
ou can actually see how much money, thought and effort were invested.The movie tried to modernize the old movie, and make it more feminist,
and I liked it very much and the old songs got a refreshing new
version. Only one thing bothered me. As a Harry Potter fan, I was really
building my hopes up for Emma Watson. But I felt like she wasn&#x27;t
connected to the character and she could play Belle a bit better.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Another home-run for Disney&#x27;s live-action re-imagining<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney continues to knock home-runs out of the park with their plan of
re-imagining their animated classics and this time they have done so
again with &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;.Headed by the beauty herself, Emma Watson, the film has a star-studded
cast of rising stars and legends of Hollywood. The entire cast does
such a phenomenal job at each of their own respective characters.
Making the audience fall in love with virtually every character on
screen. Personally, I had a strong liking for Belle (Emma Watson),
Lumi&#xE8;re (Ewan McGregor), and LeFou (Josh Gad).Visually, the film is beautiful and eye-popping. From the visuals of
the live environment surrounding the castle or village to the animation
involved in the music numbers. Everything was quite beautiful.My only gripe with any form of animation was with Beast. There has been
criticism about his animation which I can half agree with. In some
scenes, he was great and his animation wasn&#x27;t distracting but in other
scenes, his movement was choppy and evidently off.Ultimately, &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; was a great live-action film. Disney
continues to work its magic re-imagining their classics and continues
to work their fool-proof formula.-- Oberrated.com --
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great Re-make Of A Tale As Old As Time<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The Disney hit machine is in full effect with a live action remake of
&#x22;Beauty And The Beast&#x22; starring Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as
the Beast.For those rare few who are unfamiliar with the story, Stevens is an
unkind, selfish prince who angered a witch who cursed him to live out
his days as a hideous beast unless he falls in love with someone who
also falls in love with him. Stevens&#x27; palace staff were also cursed,
turning into clocks, dressers, candelabras, etc. Enter Watson&#x27;s father,
who picks a flower from Stevens&#x27; palace grounds to give as a gift to
Watson; and Stevens imprisons him for theft! Watson, being the loving
daughter, takes her father&#x27;s place as a prisoner. What follows is a
very rocky start, to say the least, to an unlikely romance between a
beautiful, young lady and a monstrous-looking creature who has much
love and kindness hidden deep in his soul, just waiting to be drawn out
by the right woman.But Stevens is on the clock: the witch has given him a rose, and when
the last petal falls and Stevens has not met anyone who he has fallen
in love with and loves him in return, Stevens and his staff will remain
as they are forever.My most memorable, movie moment of &#x22;Beauty And The Beast&#x22; is the scene
when Watson and Stevens, all dressed up, dance together for the first
time, and the song with the same title as the movie is sung by a tea
kettle.It&#x27;s been over a decade since I watched the animated version, so I was
able to judge this iteration without being prejudiced by its
predecessor. The acting was good, the sets (practical and CGI) were
lavish and bright to give hints as to its animated lineage, many
characters were memorable and larger than life, and the musical numbers
were simply amazing&#x85;I felt like I was watching an opera, that&#x27;s how
intricate and beautiful many of the grander, musical pieces were. This
movie is a must-see for any Disney movie fan.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The end was too politically correct<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Most critics have already written what I think about this movie. I can
only agree with many negative reviews here. But one thing has not been
mentioned very clearly. This movie feels like the producers trying to
shove their political views down my throat.It&#x27;s okay to have LeFou acted a little gay. Most children would not
understand small allusions to LeFou&#x27;s homosexuality. But having him
danced with another man is too obvious. And making him change the sides
is a bit unrealistic. If I were he with a &#x22;broken&#x22; heart after Gaston
abandoned him, I would have just left the scene instead of fighting
with the &#x22;good guys&#x22;. Perhaps Disney wants to make us believe that
homosexuals are actually misunderstood, and that they belong to the
good guys. But let&#x27;s be honest. The original LeFou is not a fighter.
He&#x27;s just a ridiculous butt kisser who we can laugh about. That&#x27;s all,
and nothing more.Another obvious PC point: One racially mixed couple is surely nice and
okay but why does it have to be 2 mixed couples? How many black people
lived in France back in those days?The point of the ending is too obvious. Disney wants to teach us that
it&#x27;s perfectly normal to fall in love with someone of the same sex, or
of a different race. I get it but it&#x27;s annoying, and feels like a
brain-wash.Please, make the next live action Disney movie less politically
correct. Not all people around the world agree with your political
views. Or at least, don&#x27;t make it too obvious.Perhaps Russia did the right thing by restricting the age of viewers
for this movie. It&#x27;s not a kids&#x27; movie anymore. It&#x27;s rather propaganda.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A genuine rendition of a Disney classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This is quite a brilliant adaptation of the original beauty and the
beast, it does not try and be something that it isn&#x27;t or try to be
anything more than just what it is. It was a solid, genuine and
enjoyable film. As the theme song dubs, it is &#x22;A tale as old as time&#x22;
so really what is there to change or add to? It&#x27;s a classic. But what
elevates this over the original animated version in my opinion is its
stylistic choices and its musical pieces.The visuals in this film was breathtaking, from the set design to
costume to the music really just paints a very Gothic and glamorous
&#x27;oil painting&#x27; of a scene and I loved this element of the film. The
household objects voiced by the likes of &#x27;Ian McKellen&#x27; were very good.
However the most notable performance likely came from Luke Evans as
Gaston, very much like his character in the original animated film he
really just stole every scene that he was in. One element that must be done right is the relationship between the
beast and Belle. Emma Watson is of course very resembling of Belle so
that is a plus on that part. I think that Emma Watson does a decent job
at selling the relationship between Belle and the beast and there is
genuine sympathy towards the beast, however I feel that her acting does
trip up a little particularly towards the end and this does take a
little bit off of the film as a whole. But otherwise it is a great adaptation of the original, I enjoyed the
music and it is a great time so long as you can accept that this film
does live in the shadows of its predecessor and you shouldn&#x27;t come in
accepting more than it promises because, it really is just a beautiful
and solid rendition of a classic tale.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Way better than I expected!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This was an amazing movie. Of course everyone has heard of Beauty and
the Beast. I didn&#x27;t remember much of the story; I was a young girl when
I first saw the movie and other fairy tales like it. Then after
becoming older, I grew out of fairy tales. Although I knew the gist of
Beauty and the Beast, I did not know everything that would eventually
unfold in the plot. It makes me want to get reacquainted with all of
the popular fairy tales. I really enjoyed this film a lot. Emma Watson
was fantastic and so stunning! The music was overwhelmingly
spectacular! I will check out this soundtrack for sure! &#x22;Belle&#x22; and
&#x22;Belle (REPRISE)&#x22; were great. I&#x27;m not too familiar with the music of
Beauty and the Beast, except for its title track. It was lovely to hear
versions of songs that I&#x27;m sure I heard when I was little. My only
criticism of the film is that I felt that they spent a ton of time
building up to the meeting between Belle and the Beast, that it feels a
little rushed when they actually start getting friendlier with each
other, spending time together, reading books together. I felt that the
transitioning in the middle was a little too quick and all of a sudden,
they are in love with each other. But other than that, 9 OUT OF 10! I
would definitely recommend this film. It&#x27;s not just entertainment for
young people. This is a classic fairy tale and people of all ages
should see this.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful Adaptation<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
After overcoming the fear that they were set to ruin another Disney
classic by what I branded then as an &#x27;unnecessary&#x27; live adaptation, I
eventually gave it a watch. Once you get over Emma Watson&#x27;s blatant
auto-tune, I do not think anyone can really fault this film.The costume, the CGI, the singing of both classic and original songs
were spectacular - proving there really is no one quite like Gaston!
Luke Evans&#x27; portrayal gives you the perfect balance of hatred for the
character, but unlike the animation, makes you watch with admiration
and love for his witty, self obsessed ways. Just like the arguably new
take on LeFou, you really do fall for Gaston! Josh Gad&#x27;s performance
provides comic relief, almost with a similar effect any &#x27;homosexual&#x27;
character would have in 20th Century cinema but to leave it at that
would be unfair. In comparison to the animation, the writers have
definitely upped the homo-erotic chemistry between LeFou and Gaston but
I thoroughly believe that they have only drawn that from the blatant
admiration LeFou shows Gaston in the original. Just from among friends,
relatives and the controversial news coverage, it was clear that to
have an &#x27;openly gay&#x27; character in a children&#x27;s movie is unfortunately
still classed as a &#x27;brave&#x27; decision. The comments and actions provided
by LeFou are very well timed and executed in a way that is
light-hearted and free from conservative restraint, shown with a
surrounding acceptance in the final dance scene. For me, having two men
dance with each other should not be viewed any different to Belle and
the Prince dancing and the Director seemingly had the same thought. It
is done with some ease, the camera briefly settling on the actors to
show an exchange of relieved, unreserved smiles when they embrace for a
dance, simply putting them in the norm - as they should be.From breath-taking dancing, to singing. Emma Thompson does well to make
&#x27;Tale as Old as Time&#x27; a stunning blend of old and new, her voice
definitely reflecting the beauty of Angela Lansbury&#x27;s heart wrenching
vocals in the original. Every singing cast member did well, even Ewan
McGregor with his questionable French accent. Well, everyone except
Emma Watson. Although her acting was strong, her vocals weren&#x27;t up to
standard. She seemed to have had the inability to hold any long lasting
notes, causing songs like &#x27;Something There&#x27; to lose its effect.Another worthy note is that the film did well to flesh out characters a
bit more, the story of Belle&#x27;s mother adding more depth to her
relationship with her father, Maurice. The Beasts&#x27; upbringing is more
subtly mentioned, but shows something that the original leaves out.Overall, it is a visually stunning mix of new and old. Even knowing the
story line like the back of my hand, it still managed to evoke tears
and laughter at the very same point. Nostalgic to us, or new to the
younger audience, it was brilliant.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Exceptionally Executed Except...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Literally every aspect of the original animated version with the
exception of one was not only accurately replicated but expounded upon
and deepened regarding character backstory and thematics in this
version. I loved almost every single character and every back story provided for
each. Several additional songs were included which provided great depth
to the whole story. From Belle to the baker and the Beast to the castle
crew, everyone was greatly portrayed. Of course the visuals was
astounding. My only problem was LaFou. I was extremely excited to see that Josh Gad
got the role because I mean who else could possibly do it better? He
looks and sounds exactly like him! So yes we all know he&#x27;s gay. That
really wasn&#x27;t my problem. What bothered me was the fact that his funny
grumpy grunty loud spazzy qualities were cut just to make as many gay
jokes as possible. Instead we get a weird, soft, wifey, clingy
awkwardly sexual misfit tag along that has no sense of dynamic or
timing. Literally the worst part of the movie was when one of the
greatest songs, &#x22;Gaston&#x22; was coming to a close and his character
prolongs the last note before the grand ending with senseless babbling
about how uneducated he was by not being able to spell Gaston, delaying
the music. Not one person in the theater laughed. It was honestly
uncomfortable. LaFou is supposed like a snarky animaniac. Not a girly
ditz. Horribly written inconsistent character. Should kept the
original. But other than that, SO GOOD!!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Was it necessary? No. Was it pretty good? Yes<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Yeah this movie didn&#x27;t need to be made but Disney doesn&#x27;t care. They&#x27;re
gonna do as many live action movies as they can and we can&#x27;t stop them. You know the plot.Anyway, I&#x27;ll list the things I didn&#x27;t like because I liked more things:
1. Emma Watson&#x27;s singing voice. It was weak and lacked passion. 2. The
&#x27;gay&#x27; moment. It was small and not gay enough. Le Fou, a notable
buffoon, gay? Kind of silly. Disney should spend their time making
original characters who are gay. 3. They didn&#x27;t include the song &#x27;Home&#x27;
from the Broadway show. This would have been okay if they didn&#x27;t
include the music for that song. I loved a lot of things. I loved the movie. I was really surprised
considering the live action Cinderella was kind of dumb. Things I LOVED: 1. The song &#x27;Evermore&#x27; 2. How they explained Belle&#x27;s
mother absence (both the explanation and the scene). 3. Josh Gad 4. The
added characteristics for Belle and the Beast.I liked everything else. So before you bash this movie because Disney&#x27;s greed to make more
money, watch it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An enjoyable and heartwarming family movie with a great soundtrack<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is another proof that Disney can make
heartwarming and entertaining Live-Action movies. Lets start by saying
a few words about the acting and characters. Emma Watson, despite a
shaky start, shows off her acting skills and not only that but she also
proves that she is a quite good singer. Kevin Kline shows off his
skills as well and makes a rather serious role enjoyable and quirky.
The most enjoyable part of the whole movie are the voices of the
castle&#x27;s staff. Ewan McGreggor, Emma Thomson and Ian McKellen have such
a great chemistry just with their voices and it just feels natural for
them to be like this. All the singing performances of all actors are
just amazing and heartwarming. Furthermore I must say that all the
casting decisions made here were spot on. The costumes are marvelous
and perfectly reflect the characteristics of each single character, may
it be the joy and cleverness of Belle or the sadness of her father.
Moving on to cinematography we can say that there are many great
extreme long shots of the castle, forest or simply the village that
make the viewer want to jump into the screen and spent time in this
magic land. Often the camera expresses the feelings of all characters
very well. One more thing that should be mentioned is that the whole
set and all the props are just beautiful and make the village appear so
welcoming and at home. This movie makes the viewer feel welcome and at
home in every way and I just did not want it to end because it was so
entertaining. While there is many great things to say about this movie
there are also some minor criticisms. First, Belle just seems so small
and unremarkable in the whole setting of the castle. Another thing that
bothered me was that in some scenes the lighting was off and it
appeared a bit dark. A rather minor thing was Evan&#x27;s acting appeared a
little wooden throughout the movie but luckily it was well compensated
by Josh Gad&#x27;s funny and quirky performance. In conclusion we can say
that &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is a very well made movie with an
outstanding soundtrack and great acting performances as well as some
great shots of scenery. At the end I can say that Disney outdid
themselves once more and I hope that whatever movie they decide to make
Live-Action next will be as good as this one.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>So much negativity, not that my opinion is more important, but ....<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Whether you argue that Disney has run out of creative ideas or not this
movie was totally enchanting and also a feast for the eyes with great
SFX. Not a fan of the bombastic show tunes that musicals tend to
nowadays, but I could live with it. Biggest surprise is what a great
singing voice Luke Evans has. Get that man into a musical soon. Emma
Watson sounded a lot like Anna Kendrick, but it seems she did her own
singing.

I just love wannabe IMDb movie critics. No room for nuance. Must hate
any movie unless it has subtitles. Who do you suppose the audience is?
I took my 7 and 9 year old girls. They loved it, and I was entertained.
Guess what they weren&#x27;t thinking! Whether or not CGI was getting in the
way. IT&#x27;S A FANTASY PEOPLE!!! This may also explain why they weren&#x27;t
concerned whether or not the characters were realistic enough. How many
talking clocks and candelabras do we know in our real lives?!?! Those
that want to pan this have to come to terms with the fact that they are
looking for ways to be miserable. Please don&#x27;t pollute the rest of us
with your chosen misery.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Definitely worth watching<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Contrary to the idiots who think this should be a different story than
the animated version, I actually preferred they stuck to the original
as much as possible. Some minor differences that really do not affect
the outcome. But the acting is first class. So is the music, the
singing and the tempo. And it&#x27;s amazing how well something that even in
animation is difficult to imagine can be so well done with the modern
CGI techniques! Once again well done, Disney. And please ignore the
naysayers. This is definitely worth watching and proof was the theater
was packed and all the children got out singing and loved it! Saw the
3D and I&#x27;m watching the 2D tomorrow with the wife. Yes, THAT good!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A visually stunning and musically catchy live-action remake.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
A tale as old as time, this Disney animated classic gets a live-action
makeover complete with singing candelabras, a crumbling castle, and a
cantankerous brute doomed to live out his days in solitude and regret.
That is, until the weird and wonderful village bookworm Belle (Emma
Watson) brings a slice of humanity into the creature&#x27;s cursed world.
But can this Beauty tame the Beast? We all know how the story plays out
yet that does nothing to dampen the exuberance and splendour on
display; each song and dance sequence is a feast of stunning
cinematography, fascinating choreography and catchy tunes. And the
recognisable theme song is, of course, still amazing. Musical numbers
alone, however, will only take the movie so far, so it&#x27;s credit to the
cast that they imbue proceedings with an additional layer of heart,
humour and interest. Watson is simply delightful as the strong-willed
and resourceful Belle, Dan Stevens is complex as the motion-captured
Beast, Luke Evans and Josh Gad are comically over-the-top as Gaston and
LeFou, and Ewan McGregor almost steals the show entirely as the
rambunctious Lumiere. There&#x27;s a couple of missteps blocking this
remake&#x27;s lofty ambition of matching the original&#x97;the runtime is
slightly too long, the sweeping shots of the castle become
repetitive&#x97;although it gets enviably close. A charming tale of romance
and redemption, Beauty and the Beast dazzles with visual opulence and
irrepressible musical energy.

The movie &#x22;Beauty and The Beast&#x22; 2017 version is compact with what I
have been expected so far. I had imagined the beautiful actress, the 3D
images, the new songs, and the original plot. Yes, Disney gives all of
it! Thank you :) The first I want to review is about the title. Disney
kept the original title &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; or &#x22;La Belle et La Bete&#x22;
en francais, not like other fairy tales movies, for example Huntsman,
Red Riding Hood, or others. Disney keep the title, so that everybody
can already guess the ending. The plot of this movie is easy to guess,
but the special one with this newest version is that about &#x22;French&#x22;
style, by decoration, some words, wardrobe, songs, and ambiance of the
villages. All is so-French and I love it. I appreciate Emma Watson who
can change character from the witch in Harry Potter, to the ordinary
village girl who is awkward and book-warm, even though there is a witch
also in this movie. I suggest this movie is watched by your children,
so you can teach them about morality, the important of being humble,
and the appreciation of all materials that you have now, can be cursed
by the beautiful witch :) Super bravo, c&#x27;est un bon film! :)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney Needs To Return To Pure Entertainment<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Okay, Emma Watson did a great job. Who knew she could sing so well? As
did Dan Stevens as the Beast, Kevin Kline as Maurice and Luke Evans as
Gaston. Josh Gad as LeFou - this actor has such a charming face, so
likable. Why did they have to make him a flaming whatever? For the most
part, the cast was wonderful. In so saying, however, frankly I SO love
the 1991 animated Beauty and the Beast that there can not possibly be
any improvement on it. When I hear &#x27;Mrs Potts&#x27; sing, I want to hear
Angela Lansbury. When Lumiere sings Be Our Guest, I want to hear Jerry
Orbach. Seriously. This is a good version, if a version absolutely had
to be made. But did it, beyond having to mix in some liberal views?
Here&#x27;s the thing, Walt Disney must be up there somewhere shaking his
head in dismay. Not sure who or what is in charge of the Disney world
now, but obviously someone who simply feels compelled to throw in
politically correct foolishness to the nth degree &#x96; even if it means
spoiling the movie for thousands and thousands of previous Disney fans.
Come on. Stop the insanity and get back to entertainment. Enough with
the politically correct spoilage. Get back to &#x27;family entertainment&#x27;
will you, Disney people?
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I Actually Thought This Was A Pretty Good Movie Remake.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Honestly, there isn&#x27;t much to compare the live-action 2017 Disney
remake to the 1991 animated version at all. But, I will say this, it
actually does feel more like a live-action Broadway Musical, than it
does as a &#x22;shot-for-shot/note-for-note translation of the original&#x22;
unlike Batman: The Killing Joke (2016), Psycho (1999), and the 2014
remake of RoboCop. Now, with the characters, well..not much has
changed. I mean, it&#x27;s exactly as it was in the 1991 version, but we&#x27;re
basically given more backstories on Belle and the Beast&#x27;s parents, and
their pasts, respectively. As well as some more interactions between
the servants, Gaston and LeFou. Story-wise, pretty much the same. But,
the musical score and the songs are amazing. My only gripes are, yes,
the Beast&#x27;s design shouldn&#x27;t have been all CGI, but rather, just
practical effects, puppetry and make- up. And Belle&#x27;s iconic princess
dress in the movie...still needs more volume and honestly, they
should&#x27;ve included the glove. And lastly, I don&#x27;t get what was the big
deal about announcing that LeFou was gay in the movie. Who cares?! I
still thought he was funny and the actor did a good job portraying the
character.Overall, I&#x27;m not saying that the 2017 remake is &#x22;better&#x22; than the
original, not because of nostalgia, but because it actually does feel
more another remake to a totally incarnation of the original 1991
version aka..the Broadway musical adaptation. But, if you&#x27;re looking
for something to appeal to your 1990&#x27;s nostalgia, then go watch the
original 1991 version. You&#x27;re not really missing out on much and it&#x27;s
still a timeless classic. the 2017 remake is just another version that
will have it&#x27;s own growing fan-base, for the time being.But, through it all...I actually had fun watching this movie.8 out of 10.

You can have many opinions about movie remakes. It is true, that many
times remakes are stupid and vain and many times they flop simply
because of their contradiction in terms. So is Beauty and the Beast
remake legitimate? Absolutely yes. Movie is a thoroughbred true musical
and many musicals are very populated in theaters all around the word
and people travel to see them in many theater cities around the world.
There is no reason why we can&#x27;t enjoy the new version of Beauty and the
Beast. With the new technology movie has brought back so beautifully.
It&#x27;s legendary themes sounds so lovely and familiar, that even new
generation can enjoy it&#x27;s magic and luxury. Also the movie characters
are now more profound and therefore more interesting even for more
adult audience. Beauty and the Beast takes it&#x27;s audience from very
beginning to it&#x27;s magical world and entertains it&#x27;s whole audience.
Movie follows almost exactly the original movie concept. Most of the
time it works, but not all the time. Especially at the middle of the
movie &#x22;Be my Guest&#x22; song is little too blurry and childish and could be
replaced with better scene. That doesn&#x27;t bother too much and movie
maintains it&#x27;s magic.Emma Watson as Belle manages her role very well and surprises with her
talent to sing. Dan Stevens has make-up almost unrecognizable, but
digitally created monsters face and eyes are brought to screen so
lively and humanly as possible. Strong story, great characters and Alan
Menken&#x27;s score is so beautiful watch and hear, that it sensitize even
strongest viewer. Remake of Beauty and the Beast is very well done
update of original Disney classic.Tale as old as time True as it can be Barely even friends Then somebody
bends Unexpectedly Just a little change Small to say the least Both a
little scared Neither one prepared Beauty and the beast
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I love Dan Stevens<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Am I the only one who didn&#x27;t want Dan looked by other girls? Don&#x27;t get
me wrong, i love and wish him more and more success.. I mean, this
movie was spectacular and wonderful. and Dan made us laugh couple
times.Dan&#x27;s eyes, OMG, i can&#x27;t resist!People said that they cried when they saw the film. But i didn&#x27;t. Why?
because i was too stunned by it. by him.The song (Beauty and The Beast) was beautiful, i sang it over and over
after saw the movie.SO, i give you 9. Since nothing and nobody is perfect. Good job!wish there&#x27;s a little bit twist or different plot from the original :(
AND i can see Dan a little bit longer in the movie.FYI, i have Dan&#x27;s picture hang in my bedroom&#x27;s wall since he was
Crawley. Look forward for your movies.

Okay, seriously, I was expecting to really not like this, but I was
smiling the whole way through. It was reminiscent of the original film,
but added so much more in the way of backstory, and the new music was
perfection. I honestly don&#x27;t understand why so many people are rating it badly. The
original film is still the original and it will always be a classic!
This version is thoroughly Disney and the music absolutely makes it. I
felt like I was in the theatre watching a musical whilst in the cinema,
the film had that feel about it, which I loved! Yes, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have picked Emma Watson as Belle, but the
production design and score made up for that. Luke Evans, on the other
hand, was phenomenal! Casting Josh Gad (already popular as Olaf) was a
stroke of genius from Disney as well. I also thought it was so much more emotional than the original, but
then maybe that&#x27;s just me?! The relationships between the characters
were tremendous, and it was laugh out loud funny at times. Lumiere,
Cogsworth, Mrs Potts etc were all wonderful, and the transformation
scene was just as moving as the original (maybe more!). Everyone should go see it even if they have doubts because of what
everyone else has been saying. Make up your own mind! I&#x27;m so glad I
opted to go see it and didn&#x27;t listen to everyone else!

I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s so much haterade surrounding this film, but
here&#x27;s my take...Following the awful mess that constituted the live action version of
Cinderella in 2015, I&#x27;ve been anxious for Disney to redeem themselves.
What better place to do so than with one of my favorite fairy tales.
So, with fingers crossed, I took them up on their invitation to be
their guest at Beauty and the Beast . Redemption is a beautiful thing
as is this thoroughly enjoyable tale as old as time.The casting is practically perfect.Lucy Bevan put together an ultimate check list for casting and checked
off every actor/character pairing to near perfection. While I
personally don&#x27;t think anyone can top Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts
from the 1991 animated film, Emma Thompson is a very close second.
Kevin Kline is shines as Maurice, less dotty and more three dimensional
doting/loving father. Luke Evans brings the bombastic buffoonery Gaston
to life and the pairing with Josh Gad&#x27;s LeFou is sensational. LeFou is
as devoted as ever, but more thoughtful and considerate as well. Sir
Ian McKellen is great as Cogsworth and Ewan McGrogor&#x27;s Lumiere is
perfectly charming (I only wish these two and their friendly
adversarial relationship were featured a bit more). Dan Haller&#x27;s Beast
roars onto the screen does the character justice. Emma Watson simple
radiates as Belle and has that great mixture of warmth, heart, and
tenacity the character embodies.The music is as enjoyable as ever and has a new freshness with the
addition of some new songs and scenes. Added backstory and additional
story lines ground the film in reality and bring more depth and
maturity, but there&#x27;s still a nice balance of fantasy and magic. The
familiarity and nostalgia of this film is everywhere, but this new
version made me smile (and sing along). Kudos Disney, for getting back
into fighting form with this one and bringing back some great memories
while creating new ones.I&#x27;m giving Beauty and the Beast a solid 8.5. But, don&#x27;t take my word
for it though, be a guest and see it for yourself. I recommend 3D if
you can.

I brought my 8 year old daughter to watch this because she wanted to. I
was surprised at how Disney threw in &#x22;Gay&#x22; men. This is not what Disney
should be teaching young children. I have nothing against &#x22;gay&#x22; but the
way Hollywood and the rest of society is pushing the agenda, its
becoming almost like an epidemic. I definitely didn&#x27;t want my children to see &#x22;gay&#x22; in &#x22;The Beauty and
The Beast&#x22;. It was the last thing on my mind until the scenes started
happening. I don&#x27;t watch TV at all any longer, its been around 5 years
now. The news, and all the major broadcasting companies push this
ideology onto the viewing public for a reason. As far as the movie goes I&#x27;m not into Walt Disney very much and never
have been. My kid sort of liked it. It&#x27;s child&#x27;s movie and should be
rated by children like the rest of the Disney films.

Best Disney film I&#x27;ve seen in years, perfect casting, more development
than the cartoon and the singing sounds great, you are all memeing
dips. This film was honestly great and FUN. I seriously think this
hivemind with hating this film is disgusting, its the best film I&#x27;ve
seen this year.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I don&#x27;t see what everyone is complaining about...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really did love this movie and have seen it several times! I never
re-watch movies so that says a lot. For all of the people complaining,
would you like some cheese with that whine? You have to keep in mind
that this is a children&#x27;s tale from many years ago being brought back
to life for people of all ages in live action format. The transition
will not be seamless. I think that the music was magical and the Beast had a few funny
moments. You can tell Luke Evens (Gaston) was classically trained. He
has a rich, deep and fabulous singing voice and does a great job
portraying the boorish,yet in-love-with-himself Gaston. Josh Gad is a
good and funny sidekick. I think Emma Watson did a fine job as Belle.
Physically, I don&#x27;t think she looked much like the cartoon version in
the face (Emily Rossum or Gal Gardot look more like the original
Belle). But, she is pretty and I would give her performance a 6.5 out
of 10. Her acting was a little stilted and unrealistic at times. I have
no problems with her singing voice. I think she sounded fine and
probably would&#x27;ve sounded even better if they hadn&#x27;t used so many
computerized effects on her voice. With the effects used, you really
could not hear the underlying character of her voice. No two people
have the same voice and we really didn&#x27;t get to hear what hers sounded
like without the effects. In certain parts it sounded as though she
were talking rather than singing. But, that&#x27;s my only complaint. Audra McDonald was great of course and the supporting cast played their
parts so well. I liked Kevin Kline&#x27;s portrayal of &#x22;crazy ol&#x27; Maurice&#x22;.
And that Clothilde was funny. She had an excellent singing voice and
good comedic timing. I think this movie is worth watching for people of all ages. Don&#x27;t take
things so seriously.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Excellent!!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This was an excellent, fun and whimsical film! The characters were
great and the story line follows very closely to the original.I
actually believe it may even be better than the original. I would
totally go see it again, one of my favorite Disney movies ever made.
You WILL NOT be disappointed and your kids will love it too!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I saw Beauty and the Beast (2017) and I loved it. After reading some of
the reviews of Beauty and the Beast (2017) after seeing the movie made
me wonder: did these people see a different movie than I did? I went
back to see it again, and I loved it! OK, it may not be as good as the
animated Beauty and the Beast, but really, nothing is. Beauty and the
Beast (1991) is Disney at its very best. If you just want to sit back
and escape for a little while, this is perfect. The singing is great,
the new songs added for the film fit in seamlessly, and all of the
actors in the movie did a fine job.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Concerning much of the comments made here..<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
About Emma Watson really horrible play, everybody said that its for
directors and producers to put blame on. Nobody say she is just a bad
actress or that she just needs to put some time on characters she is
going to play. The problem I hear is it&#x27;s directors and producers to
blame, but that is just great manipulation since No one can add bring
life to that lifeless horrible play of her I can tell.. Moreover both
Luke Evans as &#x27;Gaston&#x27; and Dan Stevens as &#x27;the Beast&#x27; played their
character well, or at least better then Emma Watson her Belle. That&#x27;s
to say outside of Hollywood it is Expected for characters to bring life
to their to add their own originality and to try to understand their
characters, but not by Harry Potter and Emma Watson fans, which in my
eyes is just stupid and doublefaced..
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>What a fantastical and heartwarming tale<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This film tells the story of an arrogant and selfish prince, who is
condemned to be a monster by a witch. To break the spell, he has to
find true love. I was captivated by the amazing computer graphics of &#x22;Beauty and the
Beast&#x22; right from the start. How the teacup, candelabra, wardrobe and
other household items come alive is spectacular. Belle looks stunning,
and her character is simply beautiful inside out. This is augmented by
Emma Watson&#x27;s clean, intelligent and sophisticated image. The story is
full of love, and it makes my heart melt. The first dinner at the
castle scene is spectacular, it&#x27;s very festive and grand. The ending
drives me to tears. It&#x27;s such a fantastical and heartwarming tale.I didn&#x27;t think i would like this film so much!

Of course we know that the original 90&#x27;s cartoon is supreme in every
way, but that is not to say that this live action remake does not bring
justice to our childhood.The effects of this movie are absolutely stunning, the music (both
original and new) are excellent, and the changes that have been made
are not obnoxious enough to ruin the film. In fact they even bring in
elements of the original story! Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite movies from my childhood and
this was a pleasant remake. I enjoyed the many shot for shot scene&#x27;s as
well as the backstories given to characters we had never seen before
and ones we had grown to love. This retelling is wonderful and if I had to complain about anything it
would have to be Emma Watson&#x27;s auto tuned voice, but other than that
she did a fantastic job. No one else could have brought life to Belle
the way she did. Do not sleep on this movie. You will regret it.

I went into this film with low expectations. Beauty and the Beast was
one of my favourite Disney films as a child and I really connected to
the character of Belle (the brunette with brains).Fortunately, I was incredibly impressed. Although typically I find Emma
Watson wooden and self-conscious as an actress, she did redeem herself
as the film went on, with her sweetness and gusto. She&#x27;s the perfect
Belle; a natural beauty. It was refreshing to see an actress portray
Belle with no Hollywood tweaks, surgery or artifice. Watson was born to
play the role and I cannot think of another popular actress who could
be Belle.Luke Evans as Gaston - well, what can be said. He EMBODIED this role
and brought life to the character. Lefou was also interpreted in a
refreshing way.There were a few craws that stuck. It was obvious that Disney was
trying to pander to the #oscarssowhite crowd by randomly peppering the
cast with black actors and actresses. In other films, this would be
fine, but Beauty and the Beast is a classic fairy tale, and it seemed
obvious that black actors were added to appease the baying mob. No
Asian, Latino or Native American actors for instance...I wonder why
(sarcasm off). This tendency to shoehorn diversity into a project felt
pandering and inappropriate and even took me slightly out of the film
(yes, I know it&#x27;s a film with talking cutlery and a beast but still...)
Yes, the beast was CGI&#x27;d but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I felt the
beast and Emma had a believable connection as they slowly fell in love.All in all, I was moved by this magical story and feel reconnected to
my inner child.A must watch for children (and big children) of all ages.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>One of the best live action fairy tales ever<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Why did Emma miss the musical romance La La Land for Beauty and the
Beast was the worried question thrown at her by her fans. But after
watching the live action movie (Beauty and the Beast) the question has
become pointless.Beauty and Beast is a near perfect movie in all the aspects. Bill
Condon&#x27;s directorial keeps the audience spell bound at times. The
visuals are fresh and colorful. The costumes, the CGI, the castle adds
extra color to the already mesmerizing visuals.The background score and the songs compliments the story. Alan Menken&#x27;s
work has traveled along the nerves of the movie and lives in our
hearts. Apt song selections and placements are perfect.Experiencing something you have already experienced (At least in
animation) might bore, but Bill Condon has mastered the art. His
direction never lets down the audience. He has worked hard in each and
every detail which is a huge plus for the movie.Cast performance:Emma Watson as Belle would make everyone fall for her. It is the
perfect character for her, instead she is the perfect pick for the
character. She is charming as ever, the costumes brighten her beauty.
Though the little alteration to her character might not impress few,
she still emerges our favorite.Dan Stevens as the Beast does his job to perfection. The visual effects
might shade his expressions his acting saves for it. A perfect beast
and a lover.The voice by Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, and Stanley
Tucci for the antiques in the castle were excellent. An adorable
addition to the already strong cast.What works:* Visuals and CGI effects * Songs and Music * Bill Condon&#x27;s direction *
Emma&#x27;s charm * Dan Steven&#x27;s actingWhat didn&#x27;t work:* Emma&#x27;s character alteration (A mild one though) * The first Gay
moment in Disney (Might be because of the controversies)On the whole it&#x27;s a never miss movie. Watch it for Emma, Visuals,
special effects, music and Bill Condon&#x27;s direction.

Emma Watson is a star. &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; may be flawed in its
excess, and is more touching and human than the animated original. Emma
Watson is radiant, beautiful, and inspired. This live action
reinvention of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; remains the &#x22;tale as old as
time&#x22;. Watson&#x27;s Belle is rescued from killer wolves by the brave Beast played
by the tormented and noble Dan Stevens, but he is wounded and bleeding
from the attack. He fights with great strength and rage. The Beast
unexpectedly sacrifices for Belle, and lies on the ground of the wintry
forest. Belle turns about to leave and escape her imprisonment.
Gentleness melts her visage as she turns back to rescue him in return.
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; enrolled me then.The wondrous souls of Watson and Stevens reinvent &#x22;Beauty and the
Beast&#x22;. Through astounding make-up and CGI effects, Steven&#x27;s Beast is
the towering horned majestic lion. His Beast embodies both joy and
suffering in his gentle blue eyes. Stevens accomplishes the nearly
impossible. He is a handsome man, and his Beast becomes beautiful as he
allows us to see his soul and forsaken dreams. Watson is natural beauty
with freckles on her nose. Her Belle&#x27;s innocence discovers the truth in
others, be it the Beast or the ghastly Gaston. Watson and Stevens are
beautifully sublime. With the largely familiar story-line and great songs by Alan Menken and
Hal Ashman of the original 1991 animated movie, Director Bill Condon&#x27;s
recreation is about loss, destiny, and falling in love. His spectacular
vision creates the haunting images of the wintry forest and the Beast&#x27;s
austere castle. This is a musical, and Condon wonderfully orchestrates
the song and dance. He does homage to &#x22;The Sound of Music&#x22; with Belle
singing on the hills of her village. Watson and Stevens make us believe in Belle and Beast&#x27;s love story.
There may be one too many dance numbers or introspective character
musical solos. Fortunately, they are not too distracting. Screenwriters
Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos invent the poignant back
stories of Belle&#x27;s and the Beast&#x27;s deceased Mothers humanizing this
fairy tale. This is timeless tale of true love and forgiveness. The story opens as the narcissist Prince, played by believable Stevens,
callously dismisses the gifted rose from an old woman visiting his
castle. This was his test. The old woman reveals herself as the
Enchantress, played by stunning Hattie Morahan. She casts a spell upon
the Prince transforming him into the Beast and his servants into living
furniture. He shall remain the Beast until he can fall in love with
someone, who loves him back. The Prince must do so before all the
petals on the rose fall; otherwise, the curse is forever. Belle&#x27;s opening song expresses her uniqueness. She is the independent
spirit, who loves books, and has great dreams. They do not include
braggart Gaston played by talented Luke Evans, who wants to marry
Belle. She tells him, &#x22;I will never marry you.&#x22; Belle cares for her
watchmaker Father Maurice played by kind Kevin Kline. Belle&#x27;s Mother
died years ago and she was Maurice&#x27;s love story. He tells Belle of her
Mom, &#x22;Your Mother was fearless.&#x22; Belle is like her. One night Maurice becomes lost and trespasses the Beast&#x27;s castle. Beast
imprisons him until Belle bravely takes her Father&#x27;s place. Beast&#x27;s
servants wonder if Belle is the one, who will break the wicked spell? As enemies Belle and the Beast aren&#x27;t so different. They both love
Shakespeare. The Beast reads &#x22;Guinevere and Lancelot&#x22;, which Belle
labels, &#x22;Still a romance.&#x22; He too, is a dreamer who loves books. He
shares his vast library with Belle.Belle discovers the servants&#x27; loyalty to the Beast. The young prince
was very much like his loving Mother. After she died, his Father&#x27;s
cruelty hardened his extraordinary spirit. Belle begins to see his
noble wounded heart. The Beast doubts she will end his curse, telling
his servants, &#x22;Look at me!&#x22; I know that resolve. He too is falling in
love with Belle. Condon&#x27;s ballroom dance with the Beast and Belle in golden gown is
nostalgic, new, and touching. Emma Thompson as the teapot Mrs. Potts
beautifully sings the theme, &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;. Beast frees Belle
when tragedy arises. She promises to come back. Candelabra Lumiere,
voiced by Ewan McGregor, asks Beast about the spell and Belle. He says,
&#x22;I let her go.&#x22; Mr. Potts says, &#x22;Because he loves her.&#x22; The miscalculation of the movie is villain Gaston. He is the arrogant
stupid narcissist without nuance. We cheer for Belle and Beast against
Gaston, often because nothing redeems him. Belle and Beast emerge as
heroes in this conflict. Hearing Beast say to Belle &#x22;You came back.&#x22;&#x97;
is so touching. &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; has a wonderful human quality and spirit. It
reminds of the old and recreates as new. Emma Watson is amazing in this
&#x22;tale as old as time&#x22;. Take a chance on &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;.

Beauty &#x26; The Beast is my 5th favorite movie of all time back in 1991
and when I heard they were going to remake this masterpiece(that was
nominated for Best Picture back in 1992)I was kinda skeptic. I
literally thought in my head when I heard this that Anne Hathaway,Hugh
Jackman,Danny De Vito,Jack Black and Ryan Gosling were going to be it
but none of them were and I was surprised by the actual cast in this
2017 version.So lets begin the review shall we. Now there maybe an odd spoiler but
anyways lets start.In 17th century France a young prince(played by Night At The Museum 3
star Dan Stevens)is a selfish,cold-hearted prince who would throw
lavish parties and invite everybody in. But one night however an old
beggar woman comes in and offers the prince a red rose for shelter. But
when the prince sniggers at the old woman she transforms into an
enchantress and curses him to become a hideous creature with the red
rose as his time line. The only way to break the curse is if he could
love another and earn their love in return then it will break,if not he
will remain this way along with his servants. Fast forward a year later
and we meet our heroine Belle(played by Harry Potter star Emma
Watson)who is the only odd girl in the village as she loves reading
books and exploring the world as well as inventing a washing machine to
wash her clothes. She catches the eye of a handsome yet arrogant man
named Gaston(Luke Evans)who hears her singing and he is instantly drawn
to her. But she doesn&#x27;t like him and he tries to win her over.
Meanwhile Belle&#x27;s father Maurice(played by The Hunchback Of Notre Dame
star Kevin Kline sporting a brilliant British accent)is on his way to
get Belle a white rose on his trip out when he gets taken by the
Beast(Stevens)who holds him as his prisoner. Belle saves him and she
takes her father&#x27;s place(pretty much like the original).At first Belle
and the Beast don&#x27;t see eye to eye as his hot-headed yet diplomatic at
the same time. But as the two spend some more time together they of
course fall in love. But will Gaston find and kill the Beast. And will
the Beast get Belle to fall in love with him before the last petal
falls.Now like I said I loved the 1991 classic of the same name and Belle is
one if not my favorite Disney princess of all time. So was I intrigued
by this film. The answer is YES, I absolutely loved this version of the
film. The visuals were brilliant,the songs(from the original) are all
in here along with three other songs How Does A Moment Last
Forever,Days Of The Sun and of course my favorite song from the new
song list Evermore sung by Dan Stevens. Everything about this film was
beautiful and stunning to look at. Emma Watson WOW did she nail it out
of the park with this one,and Dan Stevens who knew he had a great
singing voice. And surprisingly the CGI on the beast was OK but it
wasn&#x27;t as terrible as I thought it was going to be. As for the
transformation scene(yes I am going into spoiler mode here,you have
been warned)is very sinister and dark. I literally cried and cried when
I seen it and trust me its A lot more different than the 1991 version
where the Beast gets stabbed,in this one he gets shot 3 times by
Gaston. Yes folks Gaston shoots Beast 3 times and BY GOD was I on the
edge of my seat.The whole gay controversy didn&#x27;t bother me with Josh
Gad as Lefou being gay because he was just a total dim-witted yet smart
sidekick from Gaston&#x27;s gang. Overall I loved this movie and Ewan McGregor was very good as Lumiere
and Ian McKellan was great as Cogsworth. Alan Menken does the music for
this film again so I was happy.A -9.5/105/5See it.

Beauty and the Beast is back in a combination live action and
animation. Add a few new songs for award consideration. Great sets and
art direction all combine for an excellent movie experience.Emma Watson as Belle is convincing and her prince is best in beast
mood. The supporting cast works hard and Josh Gad continues to get the
buzz for his character. The old songs are comfortable the new ones fit.The movie is a tad long but once it gets going it moves along at a good
pace. While it is appropriate for the entire family, there are a few
intense moments that might be tough on younger children.The movie looks great on the big screen and should be seen in a
theater. The 3D added.a few wrinkles but may not be worth the
up-charge. This version of the tale as old as time will become a
classic that will be continue to be enjoyed on home platforms.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Cinema burst into applause (ignore the salty people)<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have no idea at all what is wrong with all of the salty people
writing reviews on this. I went to see it tonight, and I thought it was
a wonderful movie, the animated character&#x27;s had great voice actors. The
Beast didn&#x27;t look terrible like other people on this site are saying.
They didn&#x27;t create a super scary looking Beast that would terrify
children. They kept him as close to the original as possible. That
might have meant that he didn&#x27;t look quite as realistic as a horrible
beast might look. This isn&#x27;t a horror movie folks, it&#x27;s a charming
family film. The acting was believable enough to make me tear up at a
couple of points, so again, there was nothing wrong with the acting.The packed movie theater burst into applause as soon as the credits
started rolling. People were saying &#x22;wasn&#x27;t it lovely&#x22; as they were
leaving. Therefore, people were actually enjoying it.I give it a 9 out of 10 because I felt that the opening song kinda
dragged on a bit and lacked feeling. The rest of the film was great
though! I want to see it again!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not to find of Emma Watson<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Didn&#x27;t Think she was the best choice for Belle. Her singing was very
patched and coached. She was very bland and not very exciting to watch.
Gaston was my favorite to watch. Would recommend watching for your own
experience but don&#x27;t expect too much from Belle. The animation was very
nice and the colors were so bright. Disney really put a lot of work
into the animation and picture quality. The songs were also very nice,
with the exception of Belle,and executed very nicely.

Beauty and the BeastThe upside to marrying a beast is you can forgo getting a family pet.Mind you, the opposite species in this musical may not even make it
that far.When the mysterious owner of an abandoned castle imprisons her father
(Kevin Kline) for theft, independent adolescent Belle (Emma Watson)
embarks on a journey to take his place behind bars.On arrival she discovers her father&#x27;s captor is an anthropomorphic
beast (Dan Stevens) that was cursed by a witch, along with his
household items (Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Emma
Thompson), which are now sentient.Disney&#x27;s semi-live-action adaptation of their own animated version of
the French fairy tale, this shot-for-shot remake is a visual feast for
the eyes and fun for all-ages - even if the beast does look off and
Belle&#x27;s suitors are too mature for her.Unfortunately, the success of this fable could spark bestiality trends

Petals Fall as a Curse Finalizes. Beauty and the Beast (2017) Movie
review. France, 1350 disaster sweeps the streets, artist and inventor
Maurice takes his daughter Belle to a small and small-minded town --
&#x22;But small also means safe.&#x22; This Fantasy live action movie has a lot
to live up to from its astonishing predecessor from Disney. To live up
to such standards Disney, hired remarkable actors: Dan Stevens, Emma
Watson, Ian McKellen, Josh Gad, Kevin Kline. With such well-known
actors, the movie stands a chance.The film sticks to its roots while branching out. All the memorable
moments remain intact: the iconic rose, the curse, slurping soup.
Disney at the same time brings new life with &#x22;Days in the Sun&#x22; and the
Paris moment. Disney does well showing the transition &#x22;then somebody
bends unexpectedly&#x22; with dynamic changes. Both Belle and the Beast
become sympathetic towards each other.This fairytale&#x27;s computer-generated imagery (CGI) fits in both
naturally and beautifully. The animation much like Cogsworth runs like
clockwork, flowing scene to scene. The perfect CGI includes hat racks
boxing, saucer surfing, and candelabras dancing.Music from the classic becomes renewed, keeping the same lyrics and
oh-so-familiar tune. Beauty and the Beast also developed new wonders
like &#x22;Evermore&#x22; that capture the moments feel -- which maestro Cadenza
can even appreciate.This enchanting fantasy film earns a well deserved 4.8 out of 5 stars.
Go and fall in love with this masterpiece before the last petal falls
this April.

&#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; is Disney&#x27;s take on retelling their classic 1991
animated feature in a live-action version. Introducing an all new cast
but familiar beats, and with a perfect blue-print to follow, does this
version recapture that of it&#x27;s predecessor?1. First and foremost, if you are a fan of the 1991 film, you must try
your best to see this film with an open mind. Although the plot in the
same and the story unfolds the exact same way, there are still changes
and different variations of things here and there. Everyone&#x27;s main
complaint is the look of the Beast (Dan Stevens). I would agree that he
should have more of a vicious look, but the more I thought about it, if
the original design of the beast from the animated film was translated
into live-action, he would have been too terrifying and scare the
daylights out of the younger audiences. In that sense, I can see why
Disney altered him to be more subtle in appearance for that reason.2. Alan Menken (the veteran Disney composer) returns to score this
film, and he does yet another fantastic job in recreating his original
songs for the new cast. The movie is approximately 120mins, and this
can be in part to the addition of a couple new songs as well as more
fleshed out back-stories, especially that of Belle and the Beast.
Another complaint that crossed my ears, was the casting of Ewan
McGregor as Lumiere, having been criticized for his shaky French accent
judging by the trailers. Need not worry, you completely forget about
your doubts when you see him on screen. Not only are the CGI effects
fantastic, but Lumiere completely steals the show whenever he is on
screen, especially during the &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; song and dance number.3. The movie however, is not without flaws. To begin with, as beautiful
as Emma Watson might be, she in no way captures the spirit of Belle.
Coming to her father&#x27;s rescue a couple times doesn&#x27;t quite sell the
point that she is as brave and courageous as she&#x27;s supposed to be. She
only skims the surface of the character without bringing much depth to
it at all. Dan Steven as the &#x27;Beast&#x27; however, shows more conviction in
his role as the cursed Prince. His persona and feeling of a tortured
soul comes closest to that of Robby Benson who voiced the Beast in the
original. Sharing (a little but not as bad) the same lack of character
depth as Emma Watson, Luke Evans (to me) feels slightly miscast as the
handsome yet egotistical Gaston.4. I applaud Bill Condon&#x27;s direction as I was blown away by every
theatrical song/dance sequences in this film. Of course the most
outstanding being the classic ballroom scene which brought tears to my
eyes. I also appreciate that the Beast finally gets to perform his own
solo song which expressed his inner struggle of both anger and
compassion. Something which was clearly missing from the animated film.
There is no arguing with Disney especially when it comes to their CGI
department, because they can do no wrong. The production design in
beyond incredible with not a hair out of place. The magic is surely
recaptured whether you admit it or not. This and &#x27;The Jungle Book&#x27;
surely stand out in Disney&#x27;s live-action line-up thus far. Fans will undoubtedly nitpick this film as much as they can simply
because the animated one is sheer perfection in their eyes. Not saying
it&#x27;s not, but it be unwise not to give this version a chance, because
it does it&#x27;s best and delivers beat for beat in a spectacular way:)

The 1991 original Disney cartoon was the first full-length animated
film to be nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, and following from
Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella and The Jungle Book it becomes the next
Disney classic to get the live action remake treatment, directed by
Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters, Chicago, Dreamgirls). Basically
somewhere in France, an enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman
asks a selfish prince (apparently named Adam) (Downton Abbey&#x27;s Dan
Stevens) for shelter and offers a rose in exchange, he refuses and
turns her away twice, she reveals her true beauty, but for his
arrogance she punishes the prince, transforming him into a hideous
beast, all his servants are turned into living inanimate objects, and
all memory of the kingdom is erased from the memories of the villagers.
His only way to see the outside world is through a magic mirror, and
the enchanted rose remains, to break the spell the prince must learn to
love another, and earn their love in return, before the last petal of
the rose falls, or he will be doomed to remain a beast for all time,
and the servants will become their respective objects forever. Years
later, in the village of Villeneuve, Belle (Emma Watson) is the
beautiful but unusual daughter of artist and tinkerer Maurice (Kevin
Kline), she is appalled by the arrogance and narcissism of celebrated
former soldier Gaston (Luke Evans), who seeks her hand in marriage. On
a trip to the market to sell music boxes, Maurice and his horse
Philippe get lost in the forest, following an attack by wolves, they
finds the secluded castle of the Beast, Maurice ends up locked in a
chamber as a prisoner, for attempting to steal a rose, for Belle, from
the garden. Belle realises her father is missing, she ventures into the
forest and finds the castle, the Beast confronts her, she offers
herself to take her father&#x27;s place as a prisoner, the Beast accepts
this, and Maurice is released, Belle promises her father she will find
a way to escape. Belle meets and becomes friends with the servants of
the castle, including candle stick formed Lumi&#xE8;re (Ewan McGregor),
carriage clock formed Cogsworth (Sir Ian McKellen) and teapot formed
Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson). Wandering the castle she finds the
forbidden west wing, and the enchanted rose, the Beast is enraged, Bell
frightened runs away, the Beast saves her from an attack by the wolves,
and when he is injured during the fight, she assists him back at the
castle and nurses him back to health. Belle and the Beast form a
friendship, and the servants are convinced she may be the one to help
break the curse, the Beast allows her access to the library, filled
with hundreds of books, she may be developing feelings, but remains
uncertain due to her imprisonment. The Beast shows Belle a gift given
to him by the enchantress, a book that takes a person wherever they
want in the world, Belle uses it to take herself and the Beast to a
small house in Paris, where she used to live with her parents as an
infant, through this she learns her Mother (Zoe Rainey) died of the
plague, the Beast comforts her. Meanwhile Maurice has returned to
Villeneuve, the villagers believe him to be crazy, ranting about a
beast, but Gaston offers to help him, but reveals his true intention is
to marry Belle, Maurice refuses. Gaston leaves Maurice tied up in the
forest to die, but he is rescued by hermit Agathe (Hattie Morahan), he
returns to village and openly accuses Gaston of his crime, but Gaston
convinces the townsfolk this is more crazy ramblings, they plan to send
Maurice to an asylum. Belle and the Beast have become much closer,
sharing a romantic dance, but she discovers her father&#x27;s predicament
using the magic mirror, the Beast allows her to leave to save him, he
gives her the mirror to look back and remember him with, the Beast
realises he truly loves Belle. At Villeneuve, Belle proves Maurice&#x27;s
sanity by revealing the Beast in the mirror, Gaston realises she has
feelings for the Beast and rallies the villagers to go to the castle
and kill the Beast, Belle and Maurice are locked in a wagon. During the
ensuing fight at the castle, Gaston&#x27;s companion LeFou (Josh Gad) sides
with the servants when Gaston abandons him, the Beast is initially to
depressed to fight back, but Gaston attacks the Beast, the Beast
regains his will seeing that Belle has returned, he corners Gaston, but
spares his life. The Beast reunites with Belle, but Gaston fatally
shoots him, before falling to his death as a bridge collapses, the
Beast dies as the last rose petal falls, and all servants are turned
into their respective objects. Belle professes her love to the Beast,
Agathe watching reveals herself as the enchantress and breaks the
curse, the Beast is returned to human form, and the servants and castle
are restored to their true forms, also the memories of the villagers
are restored, with some recognising the servants, the prince and Belle
embrace, and everyone in the kingdom dances happily. Also starring
Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza, Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe,
Nathan Mack as Chip, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette, Gerard Horan as Jean
the Potter and Adrian Schiller as Monsieur D&#x27;arque. Watson is beautiful
and sings well, Stevens is good as the Beast, Evans milks the pantomime
style villain, and the supporting cast are great as well, it follows
primarily the same format, with only subtle changes, the recognisable
songs remain, including &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;, &#x22;Something There&#x22; and &#x22;Beauty
and the Beast&#x22;, plus great brand new songs, including the wonderful
&#x22;Evermore&#x22;, the costume design, production and special effects are
brilliant, and the love story element is believable, it may be more
style over substance, but all of the family will definitely enjoy it,
it is a most entertaining musical romantic fantasy. Very good!

I will keep this short. Went with my adult daughter who grew up with
the Disney Animated movie which was one of her favourites. Went in with
no preconceptions or expectations. We adored it. Love Emma Watson.
Can&#x27;t understand the horrible hatred some people out there have for
her(and usually personally aimed). Thoroughly entertained and will go
and see it again. Well done Disney. Wonderful casting, gorgeous
costumes. Pure entertainment.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A delightful, fresh take on a well-loved classic :) *SPOILERS*<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
WARNING - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!First of all, there were enough differences to make it feel fresh while
sticking closely enough to the animated original to evoke the warm
fuzzies of nostalgia.That said, there were changes I liked and changes/creative choices I
didn&#x27;t like so much. To get the &#x22;bad&#x22; out of the way, I&#x27;ll cover those
first:What I didn&#x27;t like:Character designs - While some of the non-human characters had very
interesting and clever designs, with creative ways to give inanimate
objects anthropomorphic faces and features, others were far too simple.
For example, Lumierre was a golden statue of a man with candle on head
and hands compared to Cogsworth who was a cleverly designed subtly
anthropomorphic clock. The Wardrobe and Harpsichord had faces formed
from the intrinsic features of their design whereas Mrs. Potts&#x27; face is
just painted on the side! Over all, there seemed to be a lack of
cohesion as if different designers had gone off and designed one or two
characters each without comparing notes at any point.The Beast - While I loved the character, his expanded backstory and
voice, I found his design a little bland. I&#x27;ve said from the beginning
that he looked like a Buffy demon. I dunno... just looked too human.
I&#x27;d have preferred a more &#x22;bestial&#x22; face, closer to his cartoon
appearance.Gaston - They really didn&#x27;t seem to know what they wanted to do with
the character. Instead of the impulsive buffoon we saw in the original,
he was a capable military Captain, returned to his home village after
&#x22;the Wars&#x22;. Honestly, his arguments for why Belle should marry him,
while delivered with too much over-confidence, actually seemed pretty
reasonable (Basically that they were the only two who were &#x22;bigger&#x22;
than the village and should therefore be together). Felt like the early
scenes of a rom-com where Gaston would learn his lesson and Belle would
fall for him after all. He also seemed to nice in early scenes so when
he turns to pure evil, it&#x27;s a bit of a jarring switch. I did, however,
feel echoes of the love triangle between the Phantom, Christine and
Raoul from &#x22;Phantom of the Opera&#x22;, especially the more recent
productions revised to tie in better with the sequel, &#x22;Love Never
Dies&#x22;. Also, they cut out the reprise of &#x22;Gaston&#x22; where La Fou reminds
Gaston that thinking is a dangerous pastime!What I liked:La Fou&#x27;s expanded role - From his first appearance, he seemed to be a
little more than Gaston&#x27;s lackey as he had appeared in the original.
This is particularly noticeable during the tavern song &#x22;Gaston&#x22; where
he slips coins to various people in the tavern to encourage their
participation suggesting that Gaston is not quite so universally
beloved as he likes to think. He is also the one to challenge Gaston
when he feels like he is going too far. In this interpretation, I found
him quite like Bernard from &#x22;Yes, (Prime)Minister&#x22; - taking the
subordinate role but quite possibly the smartest man in the room!Plot Holes Fixed! - So many of the plot-holes in the original are
addressed. There is no reference to the rose blooming until the Beast&#x27;s
21st year - he is cursed as an adult and he has until the last petal
falls to break the curse although no time-scale is given for this.
Also, the reference to the curse having been in place for ten years in
&#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; has been removed. Chip is seen as a human boy before the
curse so we understand that all those who are cursed become frozen in
time for however long it has been in place. Circumstantial evidence
would suggest it has been only a few years but it&#x27;s never explicitly
stated. We also learn that the curse also meant that everyone outside
the Castle would forget about it and anyone inside, explaining why the
village seems unaware of a Royal Castle within easy walking distance! A
tragic element is also added to the Beast&#x27;s back-story to explain why
the staff remain loyal to him despite it being his fault they are
cursed. The story of what happened to Belle&#x27;s mother and why her father
brought her to the &#x22;small, provincial town&#x22; was quite moving and gave
her and the Beast something else to bond over although the method by
which they discovered this seemed a little shoe-horned in and was never
mentioned again, despite how useful it might have been during later
parts of the story.I also liked the inclusion of a sub-plot from the stage musical that
the non-human characters are slowly becoming more and more the object
they have been turned into and less human (Expected them to include the
song &#x22;Human Again&#x22; but it didn&#x27;t come) and, if the curse is not lifted,
they will become permanently inanimate, simple household items. Thought
the expanded role for the Enchantress was was a nice touch.All in all, a fantastic, beautiful piece of cinema that will be loved
by fans of the original as well as newcomers who are unfamiliar with
Disney&#x27;s take on this well-loved tale :)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>My favorite Disney princess movie but...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I just saw the movie and I honestly don&#x27;t know what to say.. I LOVE the
original movie, my favorite songs and my favorite princess by far. That
being said.. I&#x27;m not sure Emma Watson was the best Belle there was, I
really love her but this movie assured me something I was fearing from
her.. She doesn&#x27;t have various facial expressions!! Her performance to
me was FLAT and that killed the movie for me.. I thought the beast had
more facial changes than she did.. Her face was either smiling or
serious or had a little tear trying to fall from her eyes and that&#x27;s
it..not a lot of excitement or emotion of the feelings she was
developing for the beast..... BUT I did like the movie, just don&#x27;t
think Emma Watson it&#x27;s a great actress.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A charming spin on a well loved tale<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Being one of my favourite childhood films, this charming spin of Beauty
and the Beast was both traditional and original wrapped in a magical
bow. The initial scene threw me a little but the more the film went on,
the more i began to love the new scenes and the originality of the
storyline. Everything from the original version that you wanted was
there with extras added to recapture audiences and bring an old story
back to life. Emma Watson was a perfect casting choice, people saying
she cannot sing - she isn&#x27;t a singer and i think it makes it all the
more charming that she still sounds lovely without being
chart-toppingly amazing. Luke Evans was another perfect casting choice
and i don&#x27;t believe anyone could have played the vain and evil Gaston
any better. A lot of people have commented on the appearance of the
Beast, saying he didn&#x27;t look frightening enough and claiming that his
eyes looked strange - it is fist and foremost a children&#x27;s film and so
there is a limit to how frightening he can appear and the entire
purpose behind his eyes looking human is because that&#x27;s how she
recognises him once he changes back into the prince. All in all i
thought it was a lovely, heart-warming film and i would definitely
recommend seeing it for yourself.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>excellent<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
i was very skeptical at the beginning,thought it would be impossible to
create something better than first beauty and the beast. but i was so
fraud... i loved everything, my hurt just melted every time i listened
to songs and i thought Emma could not be real Belle, but she was
magnificent, she is amazing actress, proved once more... i love love love it... recommend to everyone, who wants positive emotions and joy... you will
not regret it...when i was watching it, i smiled all the time, even writing this
review, i smile, because i feel so calmly and happy... thanks to everyone, who created Beauty and the Beast one more time...
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>No need for it...WHY??<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I take it for the word &#x22;SPITS&#x22; being used this is one of the reasons it
was moved to a PG? but still my daughter can&#x27;t stop
singing/laughing/shouting about SPITING!! wish i&#x27;d known this was in it
i might have been able to get around it some how! but when she started
singing it in the car i told her not to say that &#x26; wouldn&#x27;t believe her
when she told me Thats what they say in it. They could have chosen so
many other works &#x26; the children wouldn&#x27;t have noticed AT ALL!....
WHY???
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Stay True To the Original About<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Sure it will never compare to the original animation. But they sure did
true. As really it added just some extra scenes to describe the back
character of the stories. Like that of Belle and Maurice and her late mom and his wife
respectively. And why the Beast is the way he is. Which I love back
stories to why they are.But for those that complained about it never being the original. As
really the manage the producers in keeping the story as authentic to
the original.Emma Watson makes a great Belle and Kevin Kline as her father. Have
great chemistry and click well. Though Kline is taller than the cartoon
Maurice.Dan Stevens of Downton Abby as the troubled and foul mood Prince turned
Beast. As beneath his tough exterior, lies a broken heart that melts
away due to Watson.Luke Evans as Gaston the handsome but mean spirited bully and bad guy
of the film. Josh Gad as his lovable sidekick LeFou (However you spell
it), that gets no love in return from his &#x22;friend&#x22;.Rest of the supporting cast of Ewan McGregor as lovable Lumiere, Ian
McKellan as Clogsworth, and Emma Thompson as Mr Potts. As the candle,
clock, and tea pot respectively help out the young cast.Cute movie and about stays true to the original.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An imitation of substance being imitation<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This might not be even hardly accurate, but Beauty and the Beast 2017
comes across like an ideological reflection that is moral despite the
knowledge that the inherent idea of reflection isn&#x27;t moral. An
imitation of the idea that substance is in fact the idea of imitation,
thus no issue of violation.By no means is the 2017 remake an elite film, because no matter how
well it uses clich&#xE9;s or does details, the concept of the story was
never true substance, and despite the animated classic being a
reflection of the 2017 remake&#x27;s ability of the violation of reality&#x27;s
source, the 2017 remake nevertheless is too exposed as being the
imitation of substance being imitation.Emma Watson was never the right cast as Belle, but, she manages to
bring life to the film. The animated Belle was in essence the reason
for the animated movie, and because Disney&#x27;s agenda was a literal
translation of the 90&#x27;s film, the company should&#x27;ve sought an actress
that looked and sounded exactly like the animated character.Despite this shortcoming, the remake is very meaningful in ways that
compensate for the miscasting, feeling like a bang to 2015 Cinderella&#x27;s
clap. The songs work, and the visual design of the film is astounding,
from Belle&#x27;s village to the castle and forest.A great film
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Well good made<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I thought Beauty and the Beast was a great movie, well good made. It
definitely had similarities to the original Beauty and the Beast
cartoon in 1991. There were scenes that weren&#x27;t in the original so that
it could make the whole story longer to the live-action remake. The CGI
to the castle objects were outstanding considering the movie was filmed
in 2015 and took a year to make the CGI for the castle objects. The
casting was perfect; Emma Watson did an amazing job as Belle and sung
beautifully, Dan Stevens did well as the Beast, Luke Evans of course
was superb as Gaston never expected to sing good, and everyone else who
are the castle objects did awesome. Disney did an astounding job making
a live-action remake, looking forward to their other remakes such as
Mulan.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Loved this film! It was gorgeous to look at - production design, sets,
costumes. The music was wonderful, the direction excellent, everyone in
it was excellent. I&#x27;m also a fan of the original; one of the things I
liked about this version is how faithful the characterization was to
the source work. Very enjoyable and well worth the time and money.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Interesting even though I anticipated boring...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I went to watch this with my wife and daughter, thinking I would sit
there for 2 hours twiddling my thumbs in utter boredom. The start fell
right into my idea of the movie. A boring fairy tale with singing the
whole movie through. It changed though. As soon as the first person
entered the castle and then when Emma entered the castle things started
to becoming really interesting. I personally LOVED the clock and the
Candelebra. Done extremely well with a lot of laughter through the
movie. The beast was done extremely well to me. Reading some of the
comments just brought me back to the idea that there are many
sourpusses that really just go to watch a movie to try and ridicule it
and look for flaws. I bet there lives are really colorful. Emma played
her part extremely well.Watch this. Not a movie to be missed.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A remake of the Disney original Beauty and the Beast.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I am a total and complete fan of the original princess movies from
Disney and I was completely ecstatic to know that they were remaking
another classic to bring it back for the newer generations though I was
almost expecting them to change the plot as they had with Malefica.
However, I must say that I was not disappointed in any way. I loved
watching as my kids eyes lit up as they followed the plot with what I
can only say was the same enthusiasm I had when watching it so many
years ago. I am not ashamed to say as well that I too watched with a
renowned enthusiasm. I highly suggest that the Disney-loving parents
take their children to see this movie as they will not be disappointed.
I also suggest the opposition to learn to look into the value of the
message and to take their children to see it as well. Who knows, maybe
they will learn to love Disney again. Be our guest.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Nicely done!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
There are differences in this version from the cartoon, however, I
thought the movie was nicely done! Singing was great - left me with
chills (in a good way). Some new songs were added in, but were nicely
performed. Emma Watson made a beautiful Belle. I would definitely see
it again!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A fun time<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie is a musical like the Disney animation movie. A beautiful
movie that holds a candle to my childhood imagination of the original
story. There are many up and coming actors you would enjoying seeing
again and the story has a little twist or goes into more depth about
the village and the castle relationship. At least, their relationship
was a surprise to me. &#x22;Be our guest&#x22; at the theater and enjoy this
&#x22;tale as old as time&#x22;.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The movie had a lot of added parts from the cartoon<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really enjoyed the movie the roles were played well by the actors and
actresses and i don&#x27;t think they could have done any better. I would definitely Bring the whole family to see the Movie All the
animated characters were well animated and the live action character
mixed well with the animated and had just the right mix of action and
romance Im a 14 boy and i really liked the movie!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A brilliant revisit to a beautiful tale from our childhoods<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I didn&#x27;t have any expectations for this film due to the overwhelming
disappointment I felt with the previous live action adaptations of
Cinderella and The Jungle Book. It was due to this that I didn&#x27;t expect
to like this film. I was, however, pleasantly surprised.For a start, this film fixes nonsensical aspects of the original which
was a fantastic starting point &#x96; the original was never perfect so it
made sense to remake it in order to fix these imperfections. The entire
story makes more sense with the prince no longer being an
eleven-year-old when cursed; there being an explained reason for the
servants also being cursed; the fact that no one remembers the castle&#x27;s
existence; etc. There was also a more solid reason for the prince being
cursed since the audience didn&#x27;t really see much justification in the
original as there were few examples of his selfishness.The curse also comes across as more dark with the servants all slowly
losing their humanity as time goes on and being rendered inanimate
objects by the time all the petals have fallen. This introduction of
actual consequences gives an insight to the desperation of the cursed
characters as we can see how this factor leaks into their actions as
motivation, giving them more depth. It also has an emotional impact on
the audience when they resign themselves to their fate at the end of
the film. It also evokes empathy for the Beast who not only has his own
fate on his hands but the fate of everyone else in the castle &#x96; this
makes his bitterness and anger towards the beginning of the film even
more understandable due to guilt rather than just self-hate due to his
appearance as in the original. The original used this aspect to show
that Belle was making the Beast a better person, teaching him to stop
caring for his looks and be kind, but I still preferred the remake
here. Each film shows a different perspective of Beast and his
motivations (the same can be said for the servants) which is something
I love.Another great aspect would be the changes made to characters. Unlike
the original, there isn&#x27;t a single character who I felt was pointless
or underdeveloped. For example, Maurice who was portrayed as merely a
bumbling inventor in the animation had far more depth and didn&#x27;t act
like an idiot. I could also see the bond between him and Belle better.
Gaston also changed for the better, seeming more like an actual
villain. He was truly driven by his motivations whereas he didn&#x27;t seem
particularly so in the original so I was never truly convinced of him
as an evil character. Other than this, he actually did come across as
evil due to his actions more so than the original. As for Belle, I
enjoyed her character more as well as the effort they put into her
backstory. I love how they made her an inventor and showed she was a
truly capable and intelligent woman being held back by society at the
time.The most brilliant change to characters, however, was to LeFou. He was
so much better than in the original for the fact he actually had a
trait other than just being Gaston&#x27;s sidekick and you could understand
the motivations behind his actions also. I love how LeFou doesn&#x27;t just
follow along with what Gaston says with seemingly no reason and has an
actual mind of his own in that he has morals and feels guilty for what
he helped Gaston do to Maurice. The fact that LeFou seems to be in love
with Gaston gives the audience a whole new level of understanding for
his character as it&#x27;s clear he is torn between what he believes is
right and keeping the man he loves content and it shows he isn&#x27;t simply
an evil character like in the animation but a human being who is swayed
by his emotions. The film also allowed his character redemption
because, in the end, he was being used and manipulated by Gaston
through his feelings for him which caused him to be &#x27;evil&#x27;. I like the
parallels which can be drawn between the Beast&#x27;s curse and LeFou&#x27;s love
for Gaston &#x96; both made them &#x27;monsters&#x27; but there is more to them than
simply what is shown on the surface; there is good to them.What I liked most about this film is how it remained faithful to the
original, but different in all the best ways. Other than this, the new
music was absolutely beautiful and somewhat reminded me of The Phantom
of the Opera which I loved.Some scenes just didn&#x27;t need to exist though such as where Belle visits
Paris &#x96; I understand what they were trying to do, but that information
could have been delivered differently as the scene just feels out of
place (as much as I love the song). The CGI was also somewhat odd and
could have been done better.You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d be able to hear how bad the tuning is on many of the
songs. Watson&#x27;s vocals were overly auto-tuned as if they were trying to
make her sound more like the original Belle and couldn&#x27;t. Almost every
character had their vocals overly tuned at some point in the soundtrack
rendering it difficult to listen to. Some tracks are done well, but the
mixing and tuning in general just... leaves a lot to be desired. The
vocal layering wasn&#x27;t always mixed well either so it was difficult to
hear each part.As for Watson, she was the weakest link. She had some scenes where she
was amazing and other scenes where she just seemed empty in her words
and actions, like she didn&#x27;t truly believe them herself. I wish they
had cast a stronger actress and singer for this role since I felt there
was something missing from her performance.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Nice adaptation of Disney animation<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It is really beautiful and nice adaptation of one of my favorite Disney
animations. Very colorful and relaxing. Although I struggle to watch
Watson in role of Belle. Wasn&#x27;t anyone better? She was OK in total, but
she just doesn&#x27;t look like beautiful Belle. On other part Stevens
really surprised me, he was just copy of Adam.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Don&#x27;t believe the negativity<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
So, I have a bit to say. Some is about the movie, but most is about the
horrible reviews it has been getting.I&#x27;ll start with my opinion of it: I really enjoyed it. It was fun and
full of heart, like the original; not perfect, but what is? The
misfires for me came in two places: Emma Watson as Belle and the
ballroom scene. Emma Watson is a fine actress, but I&#x27;ve always felt
that her range was a bit small. Her reactions to Gaston&#x27;s advances at
the beginning of the movie are pretty much the same as her reactions to
him shooting the Beast at the end. That shouldn&#x27;t be the case. And the
ballroom scene... We&#x27;ll, the camera work and direction just felt
lacking because of the fantastic work of the original.However, that brings me to my main thrust: all of the 1-3 star reviews
here. Why? Well, after about 5 or so hours of reading, I&#x27;ve boiled it
down to a few common threads: perception of Emma&#x27;s singing, the Beast&#x27;s
CGI, and the lack of that ever elusive &#x22;charm&#x22; or &#x22;spirit&#x22; of the
original. Firstly, there are a lot of people crying &#x22;Autotune! Emma&#x27;s
been Autotuned cause she can&#x27;t sing!!&#x22; I&#x27;m not going to claim to be an
expert on Autotune. However, I have been around great singers my whole
life, and I&#x27;ll say this: if she was Autotuned, it was slight. Her
performance sounds like an above average (but not great) singer whose
vocal coach focuses on polish over emotion in the performance. Second,
the Beast&#x27;s CGI was just like Shere Khan&#x27;s in Jungle Book: magnificent
and detailed, with an emphasis on movement of hair and moisture on it.
Lastly, lack of &#x22;charm.&#x22; I thought I understood that, but when people
started talking about Bill Murray having &#x22;charm,&#x22; I was lost. Then I
realized: &#x22;charm&#x22; is subjective, unquantifiable, and is often informed
by predetermined bias; in other words, if you go looking for &#x22;charm,&#x22;
you&#x27;ll find it where you want to, and nowhere else.All of this, however, boils down even further to one shining ray of
truth: 90s kids think that their generation was the peak of culture,
and that art, music, and culture is just going downhill. That belief
leads them to look at the 1991 movie (which was fantastic) as the gold-
standard that they have an interest in maintaining. So, nothing will be
as good as it was; if this one is, then movies are getting better, not
worse, and their time wasn&#x27;t the peak of culture.Tl;Dr: Ignore the 1-3 star reviews, this movie was fan-freaking-tastic
and definitely worth the watch.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Why all the hate? I loved it!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Wow, I am so shocked by all the people on here hating on this movie. I
thought it was fantastic, a wonderful adaptation of the original
animated version. I am a huge fan of all the Disney classics, Beauty
and Beast being my absolute favorite. My VHS copy when I was a kid,
practically had a hole burnt through it from the amount of times I
watched it. I of course was hesitant about this remake, particularly
after the deluge of Disney remake failures that have disgraced us with
their presence over the past number of years. But Beauty and the Beast
surpassed all my expectations. I&#x27;ve now seen it twice in theater!The songs were all perfectly done, I found myself signing (quietly) to
them all, and the nostalgia brought on a number of tears I must admit.
There were a number of new songs that I didn&#x27;t really care for, but it
tied the story together well, so I can appreciate them for what they
were. Emma Watson was a wonderful Belle. She had the perfect description for
her, and played the part really well. She&#x27;s not going to win any
Grammys for her singing, but she did a pretty good job, and should be
commended for this. Luke Evans was definitely the highlight of the movie playing Gaston. My
goodness, what an absolutely perfect choice for this part. I could not
get enough of him! His arrogance and vanity, his voice and those strong
strong egotistical facial expressions. It was like the animated Gaston
had been pulled straight out of the screen and turned into the real
life version. Josh Gad also did an absolutely wonderful job as LeFou!
Him and Luke Evans made the perfect team. Shout out also to the CGI team who did a great job with all the talking
antiques in the castle. Great choice of actors to play the voices
behind them too. The &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; number (a personal favourite from
the original) was simply marvelous. What a visual delight! Negatives: There were a few corny moments throughout the film that
added some cringe factor, a few extra little stories lines and aspects
that weren&#x27;t from the original and a few scenes that could have done
with a little more depth. But in the end, this was not enough to change
my overall opinion of the film. Just go see this movie and let the nostalgia wash over you. It&#x27;s not
the original, but it does a hell of a good job as the remake.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I love it, but it&#x27;s not really perfect<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
*** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***Well, i love this movie to be honest. You know, my lovely Lumiere,
Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, etc are real! They&#x27;re real and its
magical. I know it using a lot of CGI, but that&#x27;s no problem. I am a
Disney&#x27;s fans and i know they&#x27;re always using CGI in every single
movie. But, i can&#x27;t gave this movie 10/10 because there is something
distract me.I just watched Beauty and The Beast (animation version) one week before
i watched the live-action version. I still remember each detail on
animated version. You know. When the beast become a human, he used a
fit shirt. And he has a really big muscle (on animated version). But,
in the live action, when the beast became a human, he used the
over-sized shirt and his muscle is gone. I know maybe Disney wanna make
this scene become make sense. Because the Beast has a big body and Kyle
Kingston is smaller than the Beast. But overall it&#x27;s good. I like Dan
Stevens. He is handsome. And Emma Watson as Belle, OMG she is
definitely a real belle! although sometime i still remember her role as
Hermione. The cast and role is perfect. And the song, to be honest, i love this
version more than 1991 version. Luke Evans as Gaston, he is handsome,
strong, but annoying in the same time. He can brought that whole
package in Gaston&#x27;s personality. And i admit, Josh Gad as Le Fou is
really helped Gaston. I mean, he gave a power and soul into the
atmosphere so the story became more alive. Overall, it&#x27;s good. I love
it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Beauty of a Film, Magical From Start to Finish!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was born a few years too late to enjoy the so-called &#x22;Disney
renaissance&#x22; films from the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s anywhere but on
home video, but they played an important part in my childhood and
remain beloved favorites, particularly &#x22;Beauty and the Beast.&#x22; At any
age, I could appreciate the top-notch, often cinematic animation; the
witty and rousing music; the excellent voice cast; and the timeless,
moving and almost operatic story.Yet as near-perfect a film as it was, I recognized where it could be
improved; mainly the spare 84-minute runtime, which precluded giving
sufficient backstory for the main characters, as well as the
development of Belle and the Beast&#x27;s relationship beyond a mere scene
or two. It was also clear that animation, as limitless as the medium
can be, was constraining to a story with such scope and detail.
Needless to say, I was extremely excited about this live-action remake,
and am pleased to say my excitement was entirely justified.Comparisons between this film and its predecessor are inevitable and
just a nature of the beast (pun intended). Is it a cut-and-paste carbon
copy of the original? No, and nor should it be. But it isn&#x27;t a
reimagination, either. In one sentence, it&#x27;s the same film told in a
new medium, touched up very gently with influences from the whole
history of the Beauty and the Beast story. While staying true to the
original film, the small enhancements make this film something fresh
and vibrant that fans, both old and new, can enjoy.The main improvement is the generous 129-minute runtime, which allows
time for exploring the backstories of Belle and the Beast, their
burgeoning relationship (which here grows out of a mutual love of
literature and is given the extra screen-time that it deserves), and
the furthering of the development of just about every character,
elements that were either missing completely or glossed over in the
original film. Rather than slowing this film down, they help add
another dimension to the characters and overall story and make it a
more satisfying experience.The Brits lead the pack when it comes to fine acting, and the decision
made on this film to have a nearly all-British cast could not have been
better. Emma Watson is perfect as the bookish, determined Belle, and
while her soprano is more pop-sounding than that of Paige O&#x27;Hara, I
couldn&#x27;t picture anyone else but her in the role. Dan Stevens brings a
dry wit to his haunted yet equally bookish Beast, while his melancholy
baritone and piercing blue eyes recall Robby Benson&#x27;s Beast from the
original film. The chemistry between them is palpable, and provides the
beating heart necessary to carry off a story as romantic as this. While
it is hard to match the passion and anguish of Glen Keane&#x27;s animated
Beast, the double motion-capture technology employed to bring Stevens&#x27;
performance to life is a worthy effort.Luke Evans is an excellent Gaston, equal parts panache and sadism, with
a soaring heroic tenor and a handsome physique that disguises the
character&#x27;s cruel heart within. The supporting cast of luminaries like
Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Audra McDonald, Kevin
Kline, Stanley Tucci, and Josh Gad are excellent in their own ways, and
bring fresh outlooks on the beloved characters without straying too far
from their animated counterparts.Alan Menken&#x27;s expanded and revised score is beautiful and thrilling,
and the new songs written with Tim Rice, while not quite up to the
level of his collaborations with Howard Ashman, work well in their
places in the film. My particular favorite is &#x22;Evermore,&#x22; sung by the
Beast in the final act. A haunting, Phantom-esque ballad, it gives
expression to the Beast&#x27;s realization that he has come to love Belle,
even as he willingly lets her go. The original songs are freshened up
with unused lyrics by Howard Ashman, and sound great when sung by this
wonderful cast.Visually, the film is a Gothic-Rococo masterpiece, with sumptuous
set-pieces and staging that would not be out of place in a golden-age
Hollywood musical. The costumes, while more period-appropriate than the
original, pay homage to the original, and strike the perfect balance
between fantasy and reality. While the animated film is in some ways
more striking, the fact that almost all of what is seen on screen was
created as a physical set and not later in CGI is quite astonishing.All together, &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; was everything I expected it to be
and more. It moved me to both laughter and tears, and as I left the
theatre I found myself wanting to see it again. What better
recommendation is there than that? For those who question this film&#x27;s very existence, I have a very simple
answer: The message contained in &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; to look beyond
appearances to see the goodness within has captivated humanity for
thousands of years, and should have expression in some medium for every
generation to enjoy and learn from. We&#x27;ve been blessed in the past
thirty years to have three masterworks: Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &#x22;The
Phantom of the Opera,&#x22; Disney&#x27;s original &#x22;Beauty and the Beast,&#x22; and
this glorious live-action remake. While it&#x27;s not a perfect film, if you
can stop quibbling over superficial details and instead consider how
well it delivers this core idea, than it is nothing short of a triumph.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A credit to the 1991 cartoon version<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
What can I say? Beauty and the beast was always an amazing movie, i
haven&#x27;t seen any prior to the Disney 1991 masterpiece but lets just say
this new remake does it pure justice.I&#x27;ve never actually watched a remake of a film that is so same yet so
different it actually works so well it makes me smile and emotional
from start to end.Emma watson and the cast was an amazing choice. The way she betrays
belle is believable and just as realistic as the 1991 classic. I cant
really give too much about this remake as its likely to instantly give
spoilers in certain scenes but what i will say it was an absolute
beautiful thing to watch. All in all if you like the 1991 version, and
you don&#x27;t like this version, your crazy. It just works well.Its not just the actors/actresses/ songs that makes it work well either
- there is some quite lush scenery in glorious modern HD that works
too, cgi is impressive and its just a movie that i feel doesn&#x27;t need to
be taken seriously or realistic - but just works in the - it does what
its intended to do Amazing job Disney and if you go and see this
regardless if you watched the 1991 version or not - if not - you will
probably end up watching the 1991 version afterwards!

Most Disney films are timeless but I feel I can relate even more so to
the films which were released during my childhood.I was 8 in 1991.Going into Beauty and the Beast I was excited to say the least, but I
was also nervous. This was a big piece of my childhood and after making
the mistake of glancing at some reviews on IMDb, I was a little worried
the film was going to be one big disappointment.Fortunately I was not disappointed.Firstly, Emma Watson was stunning as Belle. She isn&#x27;t going to win a Grammy Award and won&#x27;t be belting out a power
ballad any time soon, but her voice had a softness about it that just
worked. Dan Stevens&#x27; signing voice was just as good as were the rest of
the supporting cast. The old songs were as good and the new songs
didn&#x27;t feel out of place.Luke Evans was brilliant and his portrayal as Gaston as to be one of
the best of any characters in a Disney film. Both Gaston and LeFou are
more developed and evoke more emotion from the audience than the
respective characters in the animated film.The only criticism I can make is that the connection between Belle and
the Beast did on one or two occasions feel a little forced. The best
way I explain it is to say that this was a result of the film trying
too hard to literally reenact scenes from the animated film rather than
telling the same story in its own way.These scenes were very few and far between however, and the Dance Scene
more than made up for any shortcomings elsewhere.Belle and the Beast walking down the stairs to meet each other just as
&#x22;Tale as Old as Time&#x22; started to play was a spine-tingling moment. Emma
Watson and Dan Stevens gave this life that just isn&#x27;t possible from an
animated film, no matter how brilliant it is.I have read a lot criticism around the CGI, in particular the Beast. It
is entirely possible I am not as observant as some other people but I
just didn&#x27;t see it, at least not to detract from my enjoyment of the
film. I did see the film in 2D, it is possible it&#x27;s more noticeable in
3D.If you love the animated film, make sure you watch Beauty and the
Beast. If you didn&#x27;t, still make sure you watch it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A beautifully nostalgic movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The live action version of Beauty and the Beast is a remarkable movie,
with a lot of roses blooming with every scene played out. The cast was
spot on, the VFX was remarkable, the music was nothing short of
brilliant and the nostalgia was just right. This movie cannot be of
course compared to the original because as I said, it stands out from
its original material and delivers its own magic. It re-freshens the
story with an incredible soul and a heart that is beastly in its
grandeur, humor, romance and nostalgia.While some of the critics view
Disney as playing off of our nostalgic senses and giving us &#x22;a
mediocre, poorly made movie&#x22;, I disagree wholeheartedly. This movie is
more than just a nostalgic call to when the original movie came out and
how perfect it is. Yes, nostalgia plays a part in it but at the end of
the day, this new live action version stands on its own and delivers a
strong performance worthy of the effort put into making it. The
feelings I got when I first watched the original were a major part in
why I went to see the movie &#x96; and why others will too &#x96; but that&#x27;s
because nostalgia is all man needs nowadays; to remember that beauty
lies within. Kudos to the art direction team behind the sets in the
Beast&#x27;s Castle! They manage to create an architectural wonder by mixing
whimsically dizzying features to the castle with the brooding, Gothic
atmosphere that seems to loom over the snow/ice covered grounds. The
Castle is a portrayal of the darkness and despair that seem to have a
hold on the Beast&#x27;s heart, adding more depth into the structure of the
Castle. Alan Menken, who won an Oscar for the score of the original
Beauty and the Beast, was back to add his charm, expertise and soul
into the music behind the movie. For those of you who are familiar with
the music, it is pretty much the same as the original one which was
already super perfect. The songs have been executed quite nicely with
three new songs added as a tribute to the late Howard Ashman, whose
work on the Beauty and the Beast Soundtrack is just phenomenal. While
we were expecting Belle to woo us with her singing or at least Emma
Thompson with her warmth, we were delightedly surprised with Dan
Stevens&#x27; deep tenor- like vocals. This was the only scene in the entire
movie that I was dreading would be horribly executed and instead, I had
tears rolling down my cheeks with a big fat smile on my face. The
iconic yellow dress (which was altered from the original and meant to
show how different this century&#x27;s Belle is), the ballroom, the song
sung by Emma Thompson, the dance itself; it was just made perfectly.
The atmosphere of the dance, knowing that the Beast was hoping that
this would be the night he would tell her how he feels about her;
again, just perfect! Also, a huge nod to the creative team behind the
&#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; sequence; it was magical! That scene brought tears to my
eyes as well: it was colorful, dizzyingly dazzling, filled with spirit,
laughter and brought me back to the essence of the original &#x22;Be Our
Guest&#x22;. I was singing it out loud in the movie theater.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great homage to a Disney classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When I heard they were remaking the 1991 original, I was so excited. I
grew up in the 90&#x27;s and believe me, my VCR got a workout from
rewatching the animated version. Fast forward 26 years- I was so happy
when Emma was eventually cast. She seemed to really identify with
Belle&#x27;s persona &#x26; rumor has it, even lobbied for the part!For anyone who isn&#x27;t familiar, Beauty and the Beast is about a man who
misjudges &#x26; mistreats an old, beggar woman &#x26; is cursed as a hideous
creature. The live action version is no different- in fact almost
everything was a homage to the original. From sets, design &#x26; casting.
Josh Gad was so absolutely perfect as Lefou, I can&#x27;t think of another
actor to play this character. He worked well alongside Luke Evans&#x27;
Gaston.Emma also did a great job but I&#x27;ll admit, her voice needed work. She
isn&#x27;t quite the powerhouse like Paige O&#x27;Hara, but it was decent. Dan
plays Beast, who&#x27;s completely CGI. The motion capture stuff looks
pretty good considering they created this look head to toe. And I think
Dan probably preferred it that way- spending hours inside a buffalo
suit probably wasn&#x27;t his thing. Emma and Dan have good chemistry and
create a believable romance. Anyone who&#x27;s seen the movie knows Belle is
originally Beast&#x27;s captive. I actually thought the live action version
did this one better and humanized Beast more.The only &#x22;flaws&#x22; were maybe the added stuff. I didn&#x27;t love the magic
book which transports Belle wherever she wants, etc. But I can&#x27;t deny
that I sat through the movie with a big smile on my face. I really
think the majority of new and old fans are going to love this movie. It
works really hard to maintain the original film&#x27;s spirit, while still
reinventing itself for a new generation. Disney got this one right
guys.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Simply stunning<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I will start out by saying that I am a Disney lover! As soon as I heard
that they were remaking this I was extremely excited! After watching
once I will have to watch again to decide which version I like more.The story line followed the Disney original incredibly well adding in
only a few minor details which I personally think enhanced the movie.
Beautiful animation, fantastic acting, overall I was incredibly
pleased. I look forward to adding this to my movie collection.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>slightly above average<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Personally I loved the movie. The CGI of Beast&#x27;s face really wasn&#x27;t
THAT distracting. Sure, it didn&#x27;t look the most lifelike but every
movie has its flaws. Emma Watson was OK for the role of Belle. I didn&#x27;t
love her voice, but her acting was OK. She&#x27;s better at portraying
Hermione than Belle for sure. She wasn&#x27;t as terrible as everyone is
making her out to be. If you love Disney you will be able to look over
the flaws and accept the movie the way it is made. It didn&#x27;t have the
heart wrenching roar from the Beast when Belle left, but it was
replaced with something sadder. When everyone is turning into antiques
Mrs. Potts is panicking trying to find Chip to see him one last time,
but it&#x27;s too late. Now, I am not one to cry during movies, especially
in public, but I couldn&#x27;t help shed a tear or two (or 50) The music was
AMAZING. I watched the movie when it came out and I&#x27;m still listening
to the soundtrack. The voices in Be Our Guest were spectacular. Overall
it was a pretty good movie, but definitely not one of the best.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just watched it. It was magical, but it didn&#x27;t meet my highest expectations. I think they could put a bit more emotion to it.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Just watched it. It was magical, but it didn&#x27;t meet my highest
expectations. I think they could put a bit more emotion to it,
especially Belle and the beast. It did have few tear jerking moments,
but not as you expect. Nevertheless it was a good movie and I love the
small additional scenes which were not in the original Disney.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A completely charming, deeply respectful celebration of the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
If you loved the animated original as a child, you will be utterly
delighted by the live- action version, which, while adding depth to the
central themes and complexity to the characters and story, still
remains remarkably winsome and charming. The extra forty minutes are
used deftly, adding richness and detail only when needed, and expanding
only where the original film simply did not have time enough to do. The
love story is deepened beautifully, compelling and believable enough to
satisfy adult audiences without drifting from the sweetness and
simplicity the original. Inevitably, there are moments where the movie
falls short and you may judge for yourself where those moments occur --
but even where it disappoints, it only reminds us of the perfection of
the iconic film that inspired it. It is, above all, a respectful,
endlessly enjoyable celebration of the classic.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Enjoyable but maybe leave the really young children at home<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really enjoyed it as did my mother, I brought my young son. He found
the first half too scary. I really liked Emma in it. I do prefer the
singing voices of the original though. I think all the acting was very
good but overall film lacked that high level of magical feeling you get
from the original animation
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It hurts me to write this.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x27;beauty and the beast&#x27; was my favorite Disney film and i cried at every
single trailer they ever played. to say i was excited was an
understatement. The movie was perfectly cast-FOR THE ORIGINAL. it&#x27;s
legitimately a line in the cartoon-&#x27;if it&#x27;s not broke, don&#x27;t fix it&#x27;.
so why did we need to fix a perfect cartoon and make it a Politically
correct family friendly movie? half of the beauty and charm of the
cartoon original is that it really isn&#x27;t for kids, at all. from
Gaston&#x27;s chauvisnistic (but hysterical) lines, to an actual terrifying
Beast, toning it down was a major mistake. However, that may be
casting&#x27;s fault so let&#x27;s break it down. Emma Watson was the perfect
Belle. I was a little worried when they said they were making her a
pro-active princess, as she was already kick ass enough in the original
and even more might make her obnoxious, but thankfully the changes were
subtle. Luke Evans was a deliciously evil Gaston. Imagine how much more
perfect he would have been had he would have been allowed to do what
Gaston did in the original? and Josh Gad. a PERFECT Lefou, but let&#x27;s be
real. when you hear Josh Gad has been cast as Lefou, you look forward
to two years down the line when he has to stand outside in the snow
dressed like a snowman. erasing any trace of snow and rewriting LeFou&#x27;s
comedy was a HUGE mistake, as funny as he still was. now, the mistakes. Dan Stevens was miscast as the Beast, unless he was
intentionally supposed to be a softie. Robbie Benson&#x27;s powerful voice
in the original frightens you to death, while Stevens&#x27; portrayal makes
you roll your eyes. maybe that was the point, i don&#x27;t know, but i do
know that by making both gaston and beast softer characters, it&#x27;s not
as much a competition for Belle. The rest of the cast was fine. you
really can&#x27;t go wrong with anyone and no one did anything to really
make themselves stand out either. Now, i will admit, this film still made me emotional. I cried from
&#x27;evermore&#x27; (A+ decision to add that song) until the end of the film,
but i was still expecting more. when i watch the cartoon, i&#x27;m a mess
from the moment the music starts. which brings me to the music. You
can&#x27;t go wrong with it in this film, and I noticed something a lot of
others are pointing out: it is so NICE to have actors who ENUNCIATE and
to finally know what the lyrics to the song are. i&#x27;m 31 and i found out
i&#x27;m singing the songs wrong because the animation isn&#x27;t as clear. LOL
as for the changes made to the songs, again PC decisions. the new
lyrics were fine, and funny, but like i said, much more for kids. we
can show two guys dancing but we need to cut out &#x27;and every last inch
of me is covered in hair?&#x27;. AND ON THAT NOTE, the director was such an
idiot for opening his mouth about that &#x27;gay moment&#x27;. it was a point
second of Lefou dancing with a man, something not common in those days.
WHY EVEN SAY ANYTHING? Overall, I still enjoyed the film, I just can&#x27;t give it the 10/10 i
give the animation.

I remember watching the animated 1991 film and hearing Angela Lansbury
who played Mrs. Potts in the film sang the wonderful song beauty and
the beast which is this time around sung by Audra McDonnell. I will say
Emma Watson was great as belle since she looks the part and has a great
singing voice. Josh gad was hilarious as Lefou the sidekick of the vain
gaston who is gay in this version which brought up lots of controversy.
I will say while it stays faithful to the animated film, but I will say
that it was rather dark.

&#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; was never my favorite Disney movie, probably
because I was your stereotypical male child who craved action scenes
and the like. As I continue to get older and look for more ways to appreciate movies,
I find myself agreeing more and more that remakes and reboots are
slowly poisoning cinema as we know it. However, I do believe there is a
*right* way to remake a movie, and turning beloved Disney cartoons into
live action adaptations so that an older audience can still appreciate
their favorite childhood stories is most definitely the right way. It
worked exceptionally well with the 2016 &#x27;The Jungle Book&#x27; (my favorite
Disney cartoon as a kid), and I was hoping it would work just as well
with &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27;.For certain, the film looks amazing. The set-pieces and scenery is
extraordinary, and placing the angelic Emma Watson in the middle of it
all was perhaps the best casting decision they could have made (dare I
say this is the most gorgeous she&#x27;s ever looked?). Her singing is very
good and she&#x27;s instantly charming as Belle; no doubt she is the best
part of the film. Aside from her and Kevin Kline as Maurice, and maybe
Luke Evans as Gaston, the film&#x27;s cast failed to live up to my
expectations. Of course, it&#x27;s a problem when literally *anybody* could
have played the Beast (who, unfortunately, is the worst out of all the
animated characters. There was no emotion from the character because of
how noticeably CG he was; nothing like the animals in &#x27;The Jungle
Book&#x27;). What then happens is that on one side of the screen, you have a
heartfelt performance from Watson, but on the other side you find she
is falling in love with nothing but a video game character. The directing is an interesting thing to consider, because the film, as
you may have heard, is nearly a shot-for-shot remake of the original,
whereas &#x27;The Jungle Book&#x27; strayed from the source material here and
there. I don&#x27;t consider this a good nor a bad thing; it simply keeps me
from saying too much about Bill Condon&#x27;s directing. He proved that he
could mimic a shot perfectly, but since the film doesn&#x27;t display much
more talent than that, I hesitate to compliment or criticize it. &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27;, was in the end, a disappointment. It promises
to enchant you, but really it is just showy. The beauty of its leading
actress and the world she is singing in can only take the film so far.
Even for me, an audience member who is admittedly abnormally good at
re-watching movies and still enjoying them just as much as before, I
don&#x27;t see myself revisiting the movie and not getting bored. Too bad it could not have been more. It looks fantastic, there&#x27;s just
nothing underneath. 5.5/10

Bill Condon (Dreamgirls, The Fifth Estate, and Mr Holmes) re-invents
the wonderfully powerful fantasy tale of Beauty and the Beast,
continuing Disney&#x27;s mission to make live action versions of their
classic films. Re-introducing the lovely story of love and beauty that
we all treasure, Disney have created a fine piece of work that reminds
us of our passion for the story.As we all know Belle (Emma Watson) is a intelligent girl a head of her
time, who is snatched from her ordinary life, into the mysterious world
of the Beast (Dan Stevens), when her farther is taken kidnapped by him
and she takes his place. But as she discovers the secrets of the
Beast&#x27;s castle and furniture she and the Beast find something that
wasn&#x27;t there before. See what I did? In a visually magnificent
presence, the story we love is moved pleasantly onto the live action
screen in a colourful and enjoyable experience. Of course not replacing
the original masterpiece, the film has its own merits as its own
re-telling. These new live action films are not here to replace our
memories but show them in the real world instead of animation. I hold
that the same magic is equally qualified but with the advancements of
technology in filmmaking, the magic that animation could only portray
can be seen in real life form.Emma Watson is the perfect Belle, with no other actor coming to mind to
replace her, with her lovely appearance and character fuelling and
taking lead of her performance, Watson is an absolute pleasure. Dan
Stevens apparently taking the role of the Beast but is too layered in
CGI and voice adaptors to tell its him, but somehow making perfect
sense when his flesh self is seen. Not forgetting the jewel of the
story but the living furniture of Lumi&#xE8;re (Ewan McGregor) Cogsworth
(Ian McKellen), Mrs Potts (Emma Thompson), all shinning still amazingly
all the household appliances that we&#x27;d love to own.Luke Evans steals the show as Gaston , really showing off his self
centred, boasting character combined with the humorous match of Josh
Glad as LeFou, who&#x27;s secret is clear but barley as shocking as claimed.What can be said about Beauty and the Beast (2017) is that a it is a
very justified and fine reminder of why we love Beauty and the Beast
(1991). Not to say that its not good on its own, on the contrary it is
a very enjoyable delight with its majestic music sequences that
captures the magic perfectly. But its just not the Disney classic.The film has added its own additions and side bits, which unfortunately
bring very little to the film and could be removed with no difference
but are still perfectly fine anyway. At times I couldn&#x27;t help but look
at the film and think that&#x27;s it was very set piece-y and not as real as
it would like to be. Personally I thought I was watching a theatre play
at moments.The Beauty and the Beast song remains as indestructible as ever, but is
challenged by Emma Thompson&#x27;s slightly over sold accent, but does not
stir away from the magic. By the end of the film you re-discover the
power and love of the story.At the end of the day, Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful experience
that I&#x27;m sure will be enjoyed, but just won&#x27;t match the power of the
original, and sometimes too loud in its scenery but none the less an
absolute delight. 7.5

I do struggle to understand the reason behind so much hatred towards
this movie. Because I went to watch it in the theater and I can&#x27;t point
out anything that is actually wrong with it. The performances were
good. Much of the original material was there. So why are people
complaining so much? Truth is, I kind of understand both perspectives.
People was expecting perhaps a faithful copy of the original only with
the live- action change. Disney is bringing back the classics but they
don&#x27;t want to simply redo their old successes. They want a refreshment
too. And all the cast and the crew contributed to it in their own ways.
Disney always made a point of making movies with a message. &#x22;Beauty and
the Beast&#x22; was no different. Now in 2017, they made a great update in
my humble opinion including more background from the characters and
more themes that were quite pertinent. If you ask me &#x22; Would you take
small children to watch it?&#x22; I would immediately reply &#x22;Not before they
have watched the first one.&#x22; Why? Because this one has way more layers
than the first. Small children can&#x27;t really grasp all of it and that
would be a bit of a shame. I&#x27;ve found so many layers and dimension to
it, so much is implied between the lines. But you have to go with an
open mind. Just thinking back at the other version that French studios
did a couple of years ago, I kept thinking these past years that Disney
would have to go deeper to run against that. And they did. I couldn&#x27;t
be happier with this new version. It&#x27;s different, yes it is. But not
necessarily in a bad way.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Pure Delight for all Disney Fans,<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast is a great movie with a very well developed plot
and a mostly stellar cast. It is a heartwarming, inspired live action
adaptation of the Disney animated classic, that still has a fun,
cartoon-like flamboyancy that makes it feel like the original is truly
being brought to life. All the terrific musical numbers are also still
intact, and it is an absolute delight to see it being interpreted from
different performers.I was very underwhelmed by Emma Watson, who I actually found to be the
weakest part of the film. I initially thought she was perfect casting
for Belle, but she was actually very bland in the role, her heart was
not with it, her singing voice was also very poor, being overly auto
tuned. The majority of the characters are very well casted, Dan Stevens adds a
lot of humanity to the Beast and Luke Evan is a malicious, but still
likable Gaston. The likes of Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen and Emma
Thompson shine as the talking cutlery, Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs.
Potts, the highlight for me. It is a loving tribute to the original. While it offers nothing new,
Beauty and the Beast is great fun and I would certainly recommend it to
anyone looking for a good family film. After being forced to leave in a cursed palace ran by a beast to save
her father&#x27;s life, the young woman and the beast soon begin to fall for
one another. Best Performance: Luke Evans

My girls treated me to see this as a gift for mothers day, I went with
some trepidation because the 1991 version is my favourite Disney ever,
there is nothing I disliked about that version.Well I have to say I LOVED this! Everything was just so beautifully
done, the casting was perfect and it looked and sounded gorgeous. Even
the three additional songs written especially for this fitted so well.This will definitely be a limited edition purchase when it hits the
shops in blu-ray!And just in case you think I&#x27;m some starry eyed young
thing, I&#x27;m actually a rather crotchety 58 year old. I&#x27;ve always adored
the telling of a fairy tale.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A visual masterpiece that you MUST see....<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have to admit it...I was dead wrong about &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;. I
had absolutely zero desire to see it because I really hate remakes. The
only reason I did was because my wife insisted we go. And, when the
wife insists...we go! I have now to thank my wife and must admit she
was right...the film is terrific. The only reason I don&#x27;t score this
one an A+ is simply because so much of it is a regurgitation of the
wonderful 1991 cartoon version by Disney.So why am I so positive about this movie? Well, to me it&#x27;s simply the
most visually stunning and artistic film I have ever seen...and I have
reviewed thousands and thousands of films. I went to the theater fully
expecting to hate the picture...but soon found it took my breath
away...not just once but again and again...it&#x27;s that beautiful. And,
what I also really appreciate is that the film is the best looking
CGI/live action combination I have ever seen and the 3D effects are
much, much better than usual. With most live action films made in 3D, I
generally leave with a feeling that I could have enjoyed the movie just
as much in 2D as 3. And, all but a few scenes seem as if they were not
even shot with 3D in mind. But not Beauty and the Beast. The filmmakers
obviously thought out every possible aspect of the movie and each scene
used the multidimensionality to its fullest. Because of that, I
strongly recommend you not only see the film on the big screen but pay
the extra money and see it in 3D. Really, you must see it on the big
screen and in 3D. I have no desire to ever see the film on DVD or cable
television...it is truly a big and impressive film you must experience
in person. You can thank my wife later.By the way, a side note: I know there&#x27;s been a lot of hubbub about the
character Le Fou in this film because he&#x27;s gay. I think if Disney
hadn&#x27;t said anything about this before the film was released, most
folks would not have really cared one way or the other and many simply
wouldn&#x27;t have noticed. It doesn&#x27;t smash you over the head and I don&#x27;t
see this movie as some &#x27;gay agenda picture&#x27;...and I see it much like I
see &#x22;Some Like it Hot&#x22;. It&#x27;s a shame, as I am sure a lot of people who
were angered by this gay character probably wouldn&#x27;t be so angry if
they just saw the film and let themselves enjoy it.

Honestly people, we&#x27;re talking about a Disney live-action remake of an
animated film; not the next Pulp Fiction. Enjoy it for what some movies
are supposed to be about - FUN! This movie superbly captures the

it is - a Disney film!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A beautifully traditional fairytale, and a triumphant return to the Disney of old<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This is such a nice film. Taking Disney back to their roots of what
makes a good fairytale blockbuster, it&#x27;s a fantastically vibrant,
entertaining and traditional movie that&#x27;ll have you smiling from start
to finish. It&#x27;s very similar to the original film, but as far as
remakes go, Disney have done a fantastic job again, making Beauty And
The Beast an absolutely wonderful watch.I know that there&#x27;s so much adoration for the 1991 animation, but I&#x27;ve
never been its biggest fan. As nice as it is, it didn&#x27;t always have
that same Disney magic that I really love, so I wasn&#x27;t going into this
with my nostalgia goggles on, nor with any particularly high
expectations.That said, I had a great time with this movie. Above all, its
traditional feel makes it a properly enchanting watch, bringing back
the classic Disney magic of the 1950s and 90s that we haven&#x27;t really
seen anywhere on the big screen since.Unlike 2016&#x27;s The Jungle Book and 2014&#x27;s Maleficent, Beauty And The
Beast doesn&#x27;t hold back when mirroring its predecessor, but it doesn&#x27;t
make one bit of difference, simply because it&#x27;s such a pleasant and
magical film.On the one hand, fans of the original will get a wonderful burst of
nostalgia with the return of classic characters and musical numbers,
but also, the classic vibes of the film will make you remember why you
love all those old Disney movies. You may think that the fairytale
formula has been beaten into the ground, but watching this film, with
its hugely traditional feel, felt very refreshing.There&#x27;s nothing about this film that tries to be clever and different
to what we know can make such an enjoyable watch. With no dark
revisionism, no switching of roles, and no hesitation to burst into
song whenever it feels like it, Beauty And The Beast feels like the
Disney movie of old that&#x27;s been missing for so many years, and that
pleasant, colourful and fun-loving classic vibe is exactly what makes
it such a wonderful watch that will easily have you smiling ear to ear
by the end.Along with the excellent direction and writing that allow for the film
to be such a triumphant return to the classic Disney way, the
performances here are excellent, with a delightful turn from Emma
Watson as Belle, a whole host of hilarious A-listers as the furniture
at the Beast&#x27;s castle, Josh Gad&#x27;s funniest role since Frozen as Le Fou,
and a fantastically villainous performance from Luke Evans as the
dashingly evil Gaston.And on top of those performances are some stunning visuals. Although
the CGI of the Beast isn&#x27;t quite on the level of The Jungle Book, the
castle exterior is amazingly created, whilst the real-life production
design places you as firmly in a magical version of rural France as the
animated film, and the exquisite costume design adds even more to the
enchanting feel of it all.I have to say that I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this
film, particularly given how close it is to the original, but that
doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s completely problem-free. For one, as good as a lot of
the musical numbers are, they do occasionally feel a little out of the
blue. It&#x27;s not a huge issue, but the way that the songs are brought
into scenes is a little off from time to time, not to mention the fact
that the film&#x27;s second half is a lot more jam- packed with music than
the first.Another issue with the music comes in the form of some unfortunate
meddling with Emma Watson&#x27;s voice. She may not be the greatest singer
in the world, but what&#x27;s most disappointing is that her singing
sequences are heavily autotuned, and it&#x27;s very distracting,
particularly in comparison to either hiring another singer or just
letting her sing naturally.Finally, the Beast is a little bit of a disappointment. For me, the
animation managed to capture the character&#x27;s inner turmoil a lot
better, and as such make his transformation through the film even
stronger. Whilst it&#x27;s not bad here, and Dan Stevens&#x27; performance is
fine, I felt that the CGI Beast wasn&#x27;t quite the emotional presence
that I wanted him to be.Overall, however, I had a wonderful time with Beauty And The Beast. A
surprising improvement on the original in my book, but most of all a
beautiful return to the classic Disney style, with a pleasant, vibrant,
and wonderfully traditional vibe from start to finish.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Good, but ultimately pointless<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First off, I&#x27;m not really sure why this movie had to be made. Watching
the trailers I suspected that it was by and large a shot- for-shot
remake, and... yeah, it pretty much was.The Beast himself is far more expressive here. The CG is really good,
he comes across the most different of the characters (except Gaston&#x27;s
sidekick, who&#x27;s now apparently dealing with the fact he&#x27;s in love with
Gaston, but it&#x27;s all very minor stuff). He seems more human, and while
it&#x27;s surprisingly easier for me to relate to him in this version, I
worry that it might be at the expense of the story&#x27;s message. The
original beast looked like a wild animal, covered completely in hair,
almost always hunched over. Here he&#x27;s often standing straight, and
because he doesn&#x27;t have much hair covering his face he seems more
human. I liked the idea that you have to judge him based on his actions
and words rather than his looks, so I feel he should looks less human.Emma Watson was a pretty good Bell here, too. She didn&#x27;t really get
anything new to do that the original didn&#x27;t, but she works extremely
well with what she&#x27;s given. Oh, and she can also sing, apparently. It&#x27;s
kind of funny that it never occurred to me until I sat down in the
theater that I had no idea if she COULD sing, but once the first song
began I was no longer worried. The curse is more fleshed out here, which is nice. We learn that the
servants will turn into ordinary appliances if the curse isn&#x27;t broken,
losing all sentience. Compared to the original where they didn&#x27;t seem
particularly unhappy with their lives, this gives it more weight. We
also learn that everybody outside the castle was made to forget they
all even existed, and see that the path to the castle was blocked by a
(possibly magical) tree.There was a subplot with the enchantress who cursed them all to begin
with returning at the end of it all, which I sort of liked. I always
found myself considering her to be the real villain of the original
film as she essentially cursed a little boy for not letting a total
stranger stay in his magnificent palace for a night, so seeing that she
made sure to show up at the end of the allotted time to see how things
played out made sense. That said, it turns out she apparently spent the
last 10 or 20 years just sorta hanging out in the local village, which
if I&#x27;m being honest is really, really dumb.There was also another subplot that literally went nowhere in which
Bell laments never having known her mother. They try to link this to
the Beast also never knowing his mother and how their fathers treated
them very differently. I was honestly worried they were going to
combine these two different subplots and shout out &#x27;SURPRISE! Bell&#x27;s
mother was the enchantress ALL ALONG!&#x27; but fortunately they didn&#x27;t do
that. It&#x27;s like finding the original had half an hour of deleted scenes
that someone just decided to edit into the movie.It is really hard to talk about the characters with this movie because
this whole thing is so close to the original in it&#x27;s script, music, and
appearance that I find myself associating some character behaviors and
motives with their original cartoon version. In the original movie
Gaston was one of my favorite Disney villains, and while he&#x27;s still fun
here, he seems less villainous. The original Gaston was an egocentric
dumb-dumb. He never really made any villainous acts until partway
through the movie when he deliberately schemed to have Bell&#x27;s father
locked away in an insane asylum unless she agrees to marry him. It&#x27;s a
calculated move to get what he wants, and he has plenty of time to turn
away but chooses not to. Here he just seems to react in the moment;
when he&#x27;s told by Bell&#x27;s father that he can&#x27;t marry her, he punches the
man out in anger and leaves him in the woods. When he&#x27;s confronted
about this by some angry townspeople, he decides to have him committed
to cover up his act. When Bell shows up and reveals that there IS a
Beast and her father is NOT crazy, Gaston then insists that she&#x27;s only
saying this because the Beast placed a curse on her to say these
things, and they have to all raid the castle to stop him from cursing
them, too. Again, it&#x27;s all reactive. It wasn&#x27;t pre-meditated, which
makes him less menacing and more...well, kinda wimpy, actually. Also, Gaston goes out like a bitch. O.G Gaston fell to his death
because he cowardly attacked the Beast&#x27;s back and was thrown from the
castle. It&#x27;s his own cowardice, dishonorable tactics, and unwillingness
to relent that leads him to get himself killed. Here he shoots at the
beast, and the bridge he&#x27;s on just sorta... breaks. I know I mostly talk about the bad things here, but that&#x27;s the whole
problem. There is a LOT to like about this movie, but unfortunately
it&#x27;s all the stuff we&#x27;ve seen before. The new and/or changed stuff is
mostly forgettable or mismanaged, but it&#x27;s largely overshadowed by the
stuff we know and love from the original. The music is still memorable,
the characters still lovable, and the story is still one of the greats.
If you liked the first one and don&#x27;t mind the fact that it&#x27;s trying
it&#x27;s damned hardest to be as close to the first as possible, then
you&#x27;ll like this one, too. If you don&#x27;t particularly care to watch the
same movie all over again, though, then just save your money.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Reviews here are overwhelmingly bad and probably shying away those who liked it<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I agree with many of the negative points about the movie. Emma Watson
is cute and charming but not the best character for the role, and the
CGI beast is awful. Maybe I watched the original film too long ago, but
I thought it was a touching and audiovisually gorgeous movie that
definitely didn&#x27;t deserve less than 5 stars (my rating is actually
overrated to make it some justice).In light of the controversy that surrounded the movie, it probably left
social justice warriors disappointed. They added a new song in which
Belle suggests that she lost her innocence and became a fully grown
woman when she started to notice the kinder side of the Beast and grew
feelings for him. And LeFou, one of the characters that caused the
controversy, is one of the comic reliefs, and a very good one I might
add.This movie is definitely not in the same category as Maleficent, in
which the original story was twisted and deformed to fit a political
agenda and disown and make fun of Disney&#x27;s own mythology. It is in
almost every aspect a live action version of the original movie with a
few liberties taken. It is beautiful and family safe in every aspect (except maybe for a 2/3
second scene near the end that might raise eyebrows), and it is the
same beautiful story of love and sacrifice as the original.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Man, that was good! I did not see that coming!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
So ready to hate this movie as the animated version was a treasure of
my childhood. Let met tell you, it&#x27;s the very same movie. I know a lot
of people don&#x27;t like animated movies so it&#x27;s like they translated that
version like they would translate French to English, but the magic,
lost nothing in the translation. The magic that made that animated movie soooo good is in this version.
It&#x27;s an amazing feat that they were able to do that. That&#x27;s how they
make it work so spectacularly.I will say there were some awesome performances by the live action cast
members, especially Josh Gad who played LeFou. It was worth the ticket
price just to see this dude make you laugh throughout the film. A
stellar performance. It&#x27;s The only thing that does not make this a
carbon copy of the animated one. Plus the the art direction was great. The sets and the costumes were
fantastic. So I got to say the film works and is a rare occasion that a
remake was worth doing. Never as good as the first but enjoyable to watch.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Details DO Matter<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Although Beauty and The Beast was already a well-known tale, probably
the people&#x27;s favorite in Disney,I still find a lot more details than
the old versions which completes the story and therefore make more
sense.In this version, Belle and the beast grow their interest not only by
being a life saver, they have more communications, they do have the
chance to get to know each other deeper. Also,I also like the final
scene where there are more people in the ball room than the original
animated version,the whole village join the celebration and therefore
it is much happier than the original one.Another one is the excitement
Belle shows when she was introduced to the library,it shows that she is
more than a bookworm, but even more, a book lover.These teeny tiny details add up and make the story fuller. And I do
love this version much more,but (off course) the old one is a classic.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>beast wasn&#x27;t hot enough<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;ve been to see that movie this morning, and I have to say, I&#x27;m quite
disappointed in the beast. The beast was not hot enough for me and my
friends. Please ensure that the man that the girl falls in love with is
hot and attractive before you cast them. but overall, we enjoyed the
director&#x27;s interpretation of this classic book. and lastly, the songs
were very catchy.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Tale as Old as Time? Not by a long shot.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It&#x27;s hard not to spoil a story that we have known for 26 years but I
will try. Let me start by saying that my hopes for the movie were not
the highest in the world, but it was actually pretty good, better than
expected.The live-action feature manages to flesh out a few things from the
animated version, it wants to blend the Disney cartoon and the fairy
tale of old and it achieves just that with barely no effort. It is also
to notice that Emma Watson gives a tremendous performance as Belle and
Dan Peters tho a CGI character for almost the entire movie makes a
lovable beast. Emma Watson personifies the beauty in the inside and the
outside, you can really tell that she put all her effort into honoring
this timeless story.The supporting cast was terrific, the songs we know and love will draw
you to tears but the real diamond in the rough here is Josh Gad as
Lefou. Not only was he amazingly funny as Gaston&#x27;s sidekick but he was
also his own person and the character with more personal growth of the
entire cast, this could very well be his movie.However, what kills the enjoyment as I had feared was Luke Evans&#x27;
performance as the antagonist Gaston, he was more of a cartoon than the
actual cartoon version from start to finish, a clich&#xE9; scene after scene
not believable as a person, not even as a cartoon character. It was a
poorly written character and a horrible performance, I was by the end
either wishing I could watch the same movie with a different Gaston or
that he hadn&#x27;t even been there. Some tongue in cheek moments are also
cringe worthy and manage to kill the make belief of the story.Countering the good with the bad I have to say with a clear conscience
that I rate this 6 out of 10. Sure, it is enjoyable to be seen once,
maybe twice... but it is not at all remarkable, nor is it timeless.
There is beauty in the film, just not enough to counter all the beastly
choices the filmmakers made. There&#x27;s nothing there that wasn&#x27;t there
before.

tends to have &#x22;their&#x22; Disney feature: for my second daughter (then 4)
that film would be &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;. With a VHS video tape worn
down to the substrate, this is a film I know every line of dialogue to
(&#x22;I&#x27;m especially good at expectorating&#x22;). So seeing this movie was
always going to be a wander down Nostalgia Avenue and a left turn into
Emotion Crescent, regardless of how good a film it was. And so it
proved. Taking no chances with a beloved formula, most of the film is an almost
exact frame-for-frame recreation of the original, with the odd
diversion which, in the main, is to slot in new songs by original
composer Alan Menken with Tim Rice lyrics. For, unlike &#x22;La La Land&#x22;
this is a proper musical lover&#x27;s musical with songs dropping in
regularly throughout the running time. Which brings us to Emma Watson&#x27;s Belle. I&#x27;ve seen review comments that
she &#x27;dials it in&#x27; with a humourless and soulless portrayal of the
iconic bookworm. I can&#x27;t fathom what film those people were watching! I
found Watson to be utterly mesmerising, confident and delightful with a
fine (though possibly auto-tuned) singing voice. Her &#x27;Sound of Music&#x27;
moment (you&#x27;ll know the one) brought tears to my eyes. There are
moments when her acting is highly reminiscent of Hermione Grainger, but
this is about as crass a criticism as saying that Harrison Ford has
done his &#x22;Knock it Off&#x22; snarl again.I even felt that the somewhat dodgy bestiality/Stockholm-syndrome
thing, inherent in the plot, was deftly handled by her. Curiously (and
I feel guilty for even thinking this) the only part I felt slightly
icky about was the age difference evident in the final kiss between
Watson (now 27) and the transformed beast played by Dan Stevens
(&#x22;Downton Abbey&#x22;) only 8 years her senior. I think the problem here is
that it is still difficult for me to decouple the modern feminist woman
that is Watson from the picture of the young Hogwarts schoolgirl. (I
know this is terrible typecasting, and definitely my bad, but that&#x27;s
the way it is).Stevens himself is fine as the cursed prince, albeit that most of his
scenes are behind the CGI-created wet-rug that is the beast. Similarly,
most of the supporting stars (Ewan McGregor as Lumi&#xE8;re, Ian McKellen as
Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts and an almost unrecognisable
Stanley Tucci as the maestro Cadenza) are similarly confined to voice
parts for the majority of the film. Kevin Kline is great as the
supremely huggable Maurice. But the performances that really shine
though are those of Luke Evans (&#x22;The Girl on the Train&#x22;) as the
odiously boorish Gaston and Josh Gad (Olaf in &#x22;Frozen&#x22;) as his
hilariously adoring sidekick LeFou. Much has been made of the gay
Disney angle to this element of the story, most of which is arrant
homophobic nonsense since the scenes are pretty innocuous. In fact the
most adventurous &#x27;non-heterosexual&#x27; aspect of the film, and a scene
that raises by far the biggest laugh, relates to a completely different
character.Most of the songs delivered in the film are OK without surpassing the
versions in the original. Only Dan Steven&#x27;s dramatic new song
&#x22;Evermore&#x22;- as one of the few really new &#x27;full-length&#x27; songs in the
film &#x96; has &#x27;Oscar nomination&#x27; written all over it. However, the film
eschews the &#x27;live-filming&#x27; approach to song production featured in
recent musicals like &#x22;La La Land&#x22; and &#x22;Les Miserables&#x22;, with some
degree of lip-sync evident. Whilst I understand that &#x27;imperfection&#x27; is
not a &#x22;Disney thing&#x22;, I found that lack of risk- taking a bit of a
disappointment.In terms of the special effects, by today&#x27;s &#x22;Jungle Book&#x22; standards,
they are mediocre at best. I wondered at first if some of the dodgy
green-screen work was delivered that way to make it seem more
&#x22;cartoony&#x22;, but I doubt that &#x96; &#x96; why bother? More irritatingly, the
animated chattels in the castle, especially the candlestick Lumi&#xE8;re,
are seriously unconvincing. Mrs Potts, the teapot, and her son Chip,
the cup, are rendered as flat and two-dimensional. There should have
been no shortage of money to thrown at the effects with a reported
budget of $160 million. Where has the Disney magic gone? The film also seems to be rendered primarily for a 3D showing (I saw it
in 2D). I say this because some of the panning shots (notably one
around the library) to me just ended up as an unimpressive blur of
mediocrity. Most odd.The director is Bill Condon responsible for the modestly well-
respected but low-key &#x22;Dreamgirls&#x22; and &#x22;Mr Holmes&#x22; but also the much
derided &#x22;Breaking Dawn&#x22; end to the &#x22;Twilight&#x22; series. As such this
seems to have been quite a risk that Disney took with such a high
profile property, and I would have been intrigued to see what a more
innovative director like Chazelle or I&#xF1;&#xE1;rritu would have done with it.However, despite my reservations it is bound to be a MONSTER hit in
every sense of the word, and kids aged 5 to 10 will, I predict,
absolutely adore it (be warned that kids under 5 may be seriously
scared by some of the darker scenes, especially the two wolf- attacks).
For a younger age group, I would rate it as an easy 10*. As an adult
viewer, given that I have viewed it through the rosy tint of my
nostalgia-glasses (unfortunately you cannot hire these at the cinema if
you haven&#x27;t brought your own!), this was an enjoyable watch. Despite my
(more than expected!) slew of criticisms above my rating is still a
generous 8.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment on it, please

Greetings again from the darkness. An entire generation still enjoys
their childhood animated movie memories thanks to Disney&#x27;s The Little
Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994).
We are now a quarter-century later and Disney is looking to re-create
the magic (and hopefully cash in) with Live Action versions of all
three &#x85;as it did with Cinderella (2015) and last year&#x27;s The Jungle Book
(sensing a trend?). Up now is director Bill Condon&#x27;s mixture of live
action, CGI and music for Beauty and the Beast.The 18th century story (1740) by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve
was re-written and shortened by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont after
Barbot&#x27;s death. Director Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1946 French film version looks
to have been a key influence for this updated &#x27;Beast&#x27;, while the 2014
version with Vincent Cassel will probably now be rendered forgotten.
Screenwriters Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) and
Evan Spiliotopoulos (The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War) team with Oscar winner
Condon, whose musical movie resume includes Chicago and Dreamgirls, to
inject some contemporary aspects to Belle&#x27;s personality, as well as a
bit more backstory for quite a few characters &#x85; all while staying true
to the 1991 version.Emma Watson proves a nice choice for Belle as she has what it takes to
be nice yet tough, while still being an oddball within her own
community. Belle is a bookworm who dares to help other girls to read,
while also being the brains behind her father&#x27;s (Kevin Kline) work. She
realizes her neighbors view her as a curiosity &#x96; and there is even a
song to prove it! Ms. Watson brings strength, independence, and courage
to the role. These traits and others are on full display even before
her first encounter with the beast.Dan Stevens (&#x22;Downton Abbey&#x22;) is the beneficiary of an extended
backstory for the Prince, which includes a large dance and musical
production at the castle, leading to his being cursed for having no
love in his heart. Most of the scenes with Beast utilize CGI for the
face and head. This effect worked for me as I found the look
fascinating and able to fulfill the necessary emotions, though the
non-beast Prince would be considered the weakest link in this fairy
tale chain.Since the comparisons to the 1991 version are inevitable, and certainly
a matter of personal opinion, Luke Evans made a wonderfully pompous
Gaston, while Josh Gad was quite humorous as LeFou, Gaston&#x27;s loyal
sidekick who is also the center of the misplaced controversy (not
worthy of discussion here). The staff &#x96; both live versions and special
effects &#x96; includes Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth,
Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe,
Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette. Each
bring their own touch to the roles, with Ms. McDonald being a
particular standout, and Ms. Thompson having the most thankless job as
replacement for Angela Lansbury.While I found this version quite enjoyable and well done, it&#x27;s a bit
confusing why the decision was made to go so dark and foreboding. It&#x27;s
not young kid friendly at all, and seems as if the target audience is
millennials who were raised on the 1991 version. This was done at the
expense of inviting a new generation to explore the story and
characters. Parents should probably avoid taking any kids under age 10
or 11, and the film easily could have received a PG-13 rating. 8-time
Oscar winner Alan Menken returns to score the film (he did the 1991
version as well), plus he wrote new songs with Tim Rice and there are
some original lyrics by Howard Ashman. With only one viewing, it&#x27;s
doubtful any of the new songs will be instant classics, but &#x22;Be Our
Guest&#x22; is a definite crowd-pleaser (again). Of course, it&#x27;s an impossible task to please everyone when you mess
with the classics, but overall, it&#x27;s a nice twist for fans of the 1991
animated version. Likely a missed opportunity to bring new youngsters
into the fantastical BATB world, it does show that the animated to live
action transformation can be well done &#x85; and that&#x27;s a relief with The
Lion King and The Little Mermaid on the way. Dear Disney &#x96; don&#x27;t mess
&#x27;em up!

Imagine if Disney announced a new live action remake of Fantasia and
decided to keep Mickey Mouse in it. Try to envision how the photo-
realistic CGI might look. Not a hand-drawn Mickey swanning around with
a bucket-carrying broomstick, but an actual mouse the size of a person
wearing a sorcerer&#x27;s costume and walking on its hind legs. Also a
broomstick that has arms and hands and walks on its, er, hind straw.Would this hybrid human-rodent and its transmogrified cleaning tool
look just as magical in live action as they did in the 1940 classic?
You wouldn&#x27;t bet your house on it; the mental image required to picture
such a visualisation is weird and preposterous. If Big Mouse executives
decided to give the project a go-ahead one question would linger at the
core of it: why bother?And so now, you think this film will end up as Disney&#x27;s revamped and
bizarrely note-for-note &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; just as American
filmmaker Gus van Sant treated British Cinema, Sir Alfred Hitchcock and
his sacred thriller &#x22;Psycho&#x22; as if it were a blueprint for his much
maligned shot-by-shot pathetic 1998 remake.Condon&#x27;s movie may not have a giant rodent or personified straw broom,
but there are comparable alternatives &#x96; from the titular
bear/boar/buffalo-like creature to a range of magical household things,
including singing and dancing furniture. There are times when it will
certainly seem not conformable; but not in fact enough to make anybody
come out of the cinema with a firm belief that talking teacups belong
only in cartoons or acid trips. In fact, those who predicted this
wouldn&#x27;t hold a talking candle to the animated original are in for a
bit of a pickle and will be pleasantly surprised. The tale may be as
old as time, but it&#x27;s retold with freshness, charm and flair.Happily, gone wrong it has not. (Well. . . Kinda&#x27;)There are a few minor fumbles, but you&#x27;re likely to walk away with a
lightened step, a broad smile and at least one song-worm in your ear.The story remains rock solid: essentially a sweet two-hand-er (well,
one hand, one paw) in which two bookworms fall in love, helped along by
an assortment of sentient household items. Everything hangs upon the
casting of those two roles, but Condon has picked his leads well. Dan
Stevens appears in human form during a new prologue, in which his vain
prince is coped-up, caked in David Bowie eye make-up and surrounded by
simpering female admirers, before an enchantress appears and zaps him
with a frankly unreasonable curse. From then on, he&#x27;s in full Beast
mode, with a sub-woofer voice and giant horns, resembling the cooler,
better-dressed brother of the Faun from Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth. The CGI used
to purify furry Stevens is variable in quality, but as Beast storms
around his dank keep&#x27;s exquisitely designed turrets, the performance is
consistently strong. As much as he bellows, the wounded soul beneath
the bombast is always clear.As for Beauty, Emma Watson immediately charms in her big opening
number, in which the heroine suffers a village-worth&#x27;s of idiots
sharing (what should be) their inner monologues through song. Watson
faces one difficult sequence after another &#x97; memorable vocalised songs,
tussles with talking wardrobes, emotional exchanges with a grouchy
Heffalump &#x97; but finds just the right combination of innocence and grit.
Plus, she doesn&#x27;t sound like Fran Drescher, which is an immediate
advantage. Emma Watson is as wonderful as she is, tough, lionhearted character,
rich in self-confidence and sass, with an inspiring disdain for the
many injustices of a cruel patriarchal world.Condon&#x27;s set pieces are old school, picture book, rococo, on-the-
studio-lot style edifices, appealing in a very decent and honestly a
cartoon lover sort of way. Works for a lot of you, kids!

I&#x27;d been waiting for this movie for nearly an year ever since the first
trailer came out, and I finally got to see it the way it deserved to be
seen, seated in a plush, velvety, reclining couch, in my city&#x27;s best
&#x22;Royal Cinema&#x22; in 3-D. The animated original is a childhood classic of
mine; I know all the songs and nearly all the scenes by heart. Going by
the trailer, and learning about all the preparation that had gone in to
its making, I was expecting it to be a grand affair, and it was just
that, AND MORE.....! Everything from the luxurious sets, to the lavish
costumes, the splendid dancing and the mesmerizing songs at once
transported you to another world. I felt like I was watching a grand
re-enactment of a Broadway musical and not a live- action version of a
Disney animation. I kid you not when I say that I had the silliest grin
plastered across my face every time a familiar song number came on, as
I knew all the lyrics and every time an usher saw me singing along to
the tune, they thought I was beckoning them to order food service. I
believe Luke Evans a.k.a Gaston deserves a special mention; his role
was strong and he portrayed it perfectly. Kevin Kline&#x27;s contribution
was limited. It&#x27;s a shame we didn&#x27;t get to see Emma Thompson (Mrs.
Potts) and Ian McKellen (Mr. Cogsworth) spend much time on screen in
their human forms but their household crockery/furniture versions were
also effectively entertaining (especially Ewan McGregor as Lumiere). I
have to admit, I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on Emma Watson playing Bella as
I felt she lacked the natural charm to portray Bella as a personable
character and I&#x27;m afraid she did fall rather short in the beginning but
I confess she&#x27;d won me over by the end and she and Dan Stevens made a
lovely couple. I could tell they had put in considerable effort to
master the dance moves in the ballroom scenes which were elevated to an
ethereal level with their elegant outfits, the timeless music and their
effortless gliding across the ballroom floor. All in all, it was a
truly magical film as is the trademark of most Disney productions and I
recommend all mothers take their daughters to see this film and share
this amazingly delightful experience.

Never seen the previous version, heard about it though. Film was pretty
good but would have gained a higher score from me if some Watson nudity
was provided.Usually I buy a medium popcorn, did the same thing now. Only managed to
eat half of it though. Think that I will bring a sandwich next time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A remake that was well done<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As much as it pains me to see movies being remade, I find that I am
able to give Disney a pass for this. I thoroughly enjoyed Beauty and
the Beast . I have been a fan of Emma Watson&#x27;s, since first watching
the &#x22;Harry Potter&#x22; series several years ago. It is evident she is not a
strong singer, but her singing was pleasant enough. I think I doubted
Disney&#x27;s decision to cast her as Belle, but after seeing the movie, I
feel as if those doubts have been put to rest.I also thought the rest of the casting was well done. Dan Stevens of
Downton Abbey fame was great as The Beast (in this version, he even
gets to sing a song) and Kevin Kline was great as Maurice, Belle&#x27;s
father. Emma Thompson never fails to impress me. She was one of the
people I was extremely glad was cast in this film. She did Angela
Lansbury proud. Josh Gad (Lefou) is perhaps most famous for portraying
the lovable snowman, Olaf, in Disney&#x27;s 2013 animated film, &#x22;Frozen&#x22;
(although I knew him mainly from the raunchy Broadway show, &#x22;Book of
Mormon,&#x22; but that&#x27;s a story for another time). Luke Evans (Gaston): I
am not as familiar with him; the only film of his I&#x27;ve seen is
&#x22;Dracula: Untold.&#x22; He was pretty good as well. Ian McKellen and Ewan
McGregor were wonderful as usual. The one I was impressed with the
most, was 6-time Tony winner Audra McDonald. I have been a fan of hers
since the year 2000 when I first watched Disney&#x27;s &#x22;Annie&#x22;, and she
never fails to amaze me with her consistency and overall talent. Her
voice was, by far, the best in the movie.The cinematography and special effects were obviously all there. When
you get a huge company like Disney behind a product, they naturally
have all the money and the resources available to make the best quality
motion picture in the technical aspects that they want.Give this movie a try, it was truly beautiful.

Beauty and the Beast is the live action remake of the classic 1991
Disney animated film. Based on the French fairy tale of the same name,
this adaptation is so far the best live action update of a Disney film.In 18th century France, a beautiful young woman named Belle (Emma
Watson) is imprisoned by a savage Beast (Dan Stevens) inside his giant
castle. Unbeknownst to Belle, the Beast is actually a Prince who has
had his physical form altered by a curse. The curse will only be broken
once the Beast wins her love in return, otherwise he will remain a
monster forever.This version improves on just about everything that was enjoyable about
the 1991 film. The songs sound better, the set design looks better, and
even the pacing feels better. The film moves at a breathless speed, but
never so much that the story is hard to follow. Emma Watson is
perfectly cast as Belle, not merely for her physical appearance, but
for her range as an actress. The film even has some moments of dark
humour and the occasional self-referential quip about certain
situations the characters may be going through at someone else&#x27;s
expense, similar to Disney&#x27;s previous live action adaptation of The
Jungle Book.I rate it 8/10

Let&#x27;s stipulate to the fact that the animated version of Beauty and the
Beast (and subsequent live musical productions)are absolute
masterpieces. Beauty and the Beast may just be the greatest musical of
all time.So, let&#x27;s also stipulate to the fact that the 2017 movie production is
also pretty good. You can&#x27;t take an established masterpiece, apply a
Disney-sized budget and an all-star cast, and come out with a bad
movie. The question is, did they come away with a great movie?
Mmm...not really.Is there anything about this extravagant production that improved upon
the animated version? Well, there&#x27;s new songs that are...um...pretty
weak. There&#x27;s the new version of LeFou, and he&#x27;s umm...umm...there&#x27;s
the reimagined Maurice who is terribly miscast, drab, and lifeless.
There&#x27;s the new, not-especially-appealing, time-travel Paris schtick.
And umm...did we mention LeFou loves Gaston? Amazing, huh?So there you have it. It&#x27;s live-action Beauty and the Beast on the big
screen. It frequently looks wonderful, it&#x27;s got the great songs that
you love, Lumiere is terrific, but a great movie? There must be more than this provincial life.

You wouldn&#x27;t think that &#x27;tales as old as time&#x27; would need so much
retelling but they do. Certain properties never go away or are open to
constant reinterpretation like the Shakespeare oeuvre or, well, fairy
tales. A cursory bit of research reveals that there have been at least
a dozen feature films or TV series from various countries based on
Beauty and the Beast tale.If you have never existed before today, here&#x27;s what you need to know: A
cruel prince is cursed and transformed into a beast. If the Beast
doesn&#x27;t learn to love and be loved in return by the time the last petal
on a magic rose falls, the curse will become permanent. Enter a
beautiful girl who could be the one to break the spell.

Directed by Bill CondonStarring Emma Watson, Dan Stevens and Luke EvansPlot Overview: &#x200B;After her father is kidnapped and held hostage in a
mysterious castle, Belle(Emma Watson) takes his place but soon begins
falling for her captor... a beast(Dan Stevens)!I get the hate for this movie. Nothing exceeds the original and the
original will be marked as an all time classic. If you compare both
these movies side by side, this movie will suck, I promise you that.
Despite that, this movie is still entertaining. Flawed? Yes. Outright
awful? No. It has its flaws, nearly every movie does, but that doesn&#x27;t
take away from some of the good in this movie. If you haven&#x27;t seen the
original(I recommend you do) I imagine you&#x27;ll enjoy this movie for the
most part. If you have seen the original and are going to constantly
compare this movie to that, then you won&#x27;t enjoy this movie. Overall, I
will say this movie is worth watching, and I imagine most
audiences(especially children) will really enjoy this movie. Also, if
you prevent your child/refuse to see this movie because of the alleged
Le Foue gay controversy then you have nothing to worry about. They
gloss over it is seconds and it won&#x27;t bother you at all.The story is a &#x27;tale as old as time&#x27; but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less
magical, exciting and enjoyable. It&#x27;s pretty much the story of the
original with a few tweaks here and there so if you&#x27;ve seen the
original, you&#x27;ll know the story and won&#x27;t be surprised(much) but if you
haven&#x27;t then you&#x27;ll get to experience a wonderful story for the first
time in live action. Either way, it&#x27;s a good story. I will say that most of the casting in this movie is absolutely
flawless. Emma Watson was fine as Belle but she isn&#x27;t the best singer
and when she is, it&#x27;s clearly been heavily edited. They explore Belle&#x27;s
character more in this version which I will say was pretty nice and a
welcome inclusion. Dan Stevens was great as the Beast but I do feel
like he could have put more care into some of his scenes and not rushed
things. There were many scenes that should have had greater meaning and
effect but didn&#x27;t, and that was down partly to Steven&#x27;s portrayal but
mostly down to Condon&#x27;s direction. I also didn&#x27;t like the arc of the
Beast and though it was primarily just a straight line with no curves
or edges. Luke Evans was just fantastic as Gaston and plays the part to
perfection. He made the role his own and was easily one of the best
parts of this movie. Gaston is also just a really great villain. He&#x27;s
awesome. You can&#x27;t mention Gaston without his buddy Le Foue(played
wonderfully by Josh Gad) who has had some tweaks to his character and
arc(some of which stupidly garnered controversy) all of which I like
and am happy Disney went with. Both Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen were
great as Lumiere and Cogsworth respectively and both their characters
stood out for me. Kevin Kline was also really good as Maurice and the
relationship between him and Belle was explored more and was another
welcome improvement. On a technical standpoint, this movie is absolutely gorgeous and looks
amazing. The visual effects were all awesome, even if I would have done
the Beast a tad differently. Both the costume and set design were all
really good and looked nice with the time period. The cinematography
was also amazing.While this movie made some minor changes, it didn&#x27;t add/remove/alter
enough for me to say a sequel was needed or warranted. It was
reasonably funny but some of the jokes were clearly aimed at the lowest
possible denominator. It did need to reintroduce this classic tale to
children of this age but some of the kids in my audience were crying
and even I was pretty shocked by how graphic some scenes were(as far as
making the audience scared goes) and scare factor of some scenes. The
action was amazing though and it didn&#x27;t even need to be that great.They do carry over much of the music from the original(while adding new
songs) but none of them are done as well as in the original and none of
them were performed to a spectacular degree. In conclusion, if you can ignore the existence of the original you will
most likely enjoy this movie. The acting is great, the story is great,
the visuals are gorgeous but it does lack some of the charm and sense
of wonder that the original did posses. Despite this, I can say I
recommend this movie as long as you can forget the existence of the
1991 Classic.7/10Would Recommend

The hype and advertising for this film has been incredible. It&#x27;s been
in our faces for months, and after seeing the raving praise of
particularly Emma Watson but also the film as a whole, I was nervous to
watch it myself. I was so desperate to like it and so nervous I
wouldn&#x27;t, and yet when I sat down and the movie began, I was swept away
without a conscious choice. I was won over instantly.The visuals are spectacular. They&#x27;re dazzling, overwhelming, and the
scenes are exquisitely detailed. The sets are magical and intelligent
and vivid, and I was frequently breathless in awe of the beauty
unfolding before my eyes. From the costumes to the set pieces to what
felt like very real magic sprinkled over each scene, the film was a
feast for the eyes. Not to mention the excellent cinematography. With
visuals like this, it goes without saying that the gorgeousness be
captured and appreciated from all angles, and it was - to every last
detail.The pacing is perfect. The humour - thanks to the epic comic duo of
Josh Had and Luke Evans - made for some deliciously laugh-out-loud
moments, and I just adored it. The balance between comedy and tragedy
and magic is perfect, and I felt every emotion when I was supposed to
feel it; and vividly so. I laughed, I cried, and I lost myself in the
magic. It sticks exactly to the original story, which makes me think it
isn&#x27;t really a retelling. Yes, Belle&#x27;s character was altered a lot, but
the film feels like it&#x27;s just the original dazzled up. I&#x27;m not
criticising, just commenting: there were no big twists on the original
story and no surprises. I was personally a bit disappointed with that.
The musical score is fantastic. The songs are catchy, atmospheric, and
charming, and I was very impressed with the cast&#x27;s singing. Auto tune
does help, though ;) I thought that was quite obvious with Emma&#x27;s
voice. The acting is generally excellent. I thought Luke Evans and Josh Had
easily stole the show, and the supporting cast weren&#x27;t far behind.
Evans and Gad are effortlessly Gaston and LeFou, and their scenes were
always full of skill, humour, and vitality. Emma Thompson, Ewan
McGregor and Ian McKellen are also superb, despite spending most of
their screen time voicing animate objects. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens
didn&#x27;t blow me away. Please don&#x27;t hate me for saying this, but I don&#x27;t
think Watson&#x27;s a great actress at all. I do think she&#x27;s lovely in this
film and it&#x27;s definitely her best performance to date, but I don&#x27;t
think her acting is amazing. I also loved Belle&#x27;s character development
and the &#x22;feminist&#x22; slant to her character. And the character
development is wonderful. I loved how in particular Belle and her
father grew throughout the film and how they changed. Their arcs are
impressive, and I soaked up the depth. But Kevin Kline as Maurice is
the highlight for me (along with Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as
LeFou). Kline&#x27;s performance is just phenomenal. I frequently had tears
in my eyes simply because his portrayal of Maurice conveyed such
gentle, tender, aching pain and his facial expressions were
heartbreaking. He acts brilliantly, and I loved his performance.Beauty and the Beast is a masterpiece of incredible visuals and
skillful scenes, and perfectly balances tragedy, comedy, romance and
magic. It&#x27;s dazzling, satisfying, overwhelming, and I loved it -
despite being disappointed with Stevens and Watson. The supporting cast
and the visuals were the highlight of the film for me, and I highly
recommend it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Another Review<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First, LOL because the hundreds of user reviews are mostly negative and
their main gripe was it was either too much or too little like the
animated version. Yes, apparently it can be both. This movie is a good adaption. I repeat for the half of the public who
have the comprehension of a potato: it&#x27;s an adaption of the
fairy-tale--not intended to be a copy of the animated film. It included
the classic elements of the animated film as to be a tribute and enough
originality to be memorable and stand on its own. The depth of the
story line is phenomenal.I was surprised to see almost the same objections in so many reviews
that lead people to dislike the film so to be fully prepared, you will
be disappointed if you compare things like:-More emotion or expression. The household objects faces won&#x27;t be as
animated as the cartoon. The characters (Belle, Beast, etc.) won&#x27;t be
as dramatic/emotionally expressive as the animated film(it&#x27;s not a Broadway play and the animated film was supposed to be
dramatic bc it&#x27;s a kids movie) -The Beast&#x27;s eyes to look CGI (good
news--they&#x27;re actually Dan Steven&#x27;s eyes)I actually enjoyed this live-action more than the 1991 film. The CGI
wasn&#x27;t perfect (but it was good) and I missed the voice of Angela
Lansbury, but the ballroom dance scene was the only one which could
have met a higher expectation (maybe it needed more film angles). Also,
one of the main wins for the script was making the beast appear more a
human trapped as a beast (He felt like a person--even the same person
in his beast or man form). Overall, wonderful movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>there are too many song.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
there are too many songs in the movie, and this was annoying after 5.or
6.song. I don&#x27;t know. I didn&#x27;t remember because I quite listening.
Also, singers&#x27; voices are too high and sharp. apart from these parts
the other parts are good, I liked it only. I expected more beautiful
movie.

I have been wondering while listening to the reviews of this latest
version of Disney&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast how many of the critics
panning it are Millennials who were kids when this came out and have
been spoiled by the era of CGI. I was an adult when that film came out
but loved it anyway. The 1991 version was a leap forward in Animation
with its use of computer produced art and the more intimate
storytelling that was only seen before in moments of The Little
Mermaid. When they said Disney had turned it into Broadway Musical I wasn&#x27;t
surprised because that is essentially what this is. It&#x27;s a
Menken/Ashman (with some help from Tim Rice) musical of which the 1991
film was simply one version. Menken and Ashman both treated it that way
and the film was all that better for it. If you look at it from that
perspective the why of redoing it can be answered. Like any other well-
loved musical doing it again with a different cast and director will
always be something people will want to do. I think it&#x27;s time to see
this for a new generation. This is a visually stunning film. The CGI of the Beast was only
distracting in the beginning but once you got connected to the
performance that Dan Stevens gives it no longer matters. Like the 1991
version the colors in this film are vivid and bold. The set decoration
and costuming are lavish and beautiful. The character design of the
household objects is amazingly detailed. The film hearkens back in some
ways to musical extravaganzas of the 50s and the 60. The &#x22;Belle&#x22;
sequence reminded me of the film version of the Oliver musical. The
&#x22;Gaston&#x22; sequence had moments that reminded me of Seven Brides for
Seven Brothers and when Emma Watson sings &#x22;Belle (Reprise)&#x22; reminded me
of Sound of Music. The end titles even had nod to the same genre. The musical numbers were very well done particularly the rendition of
the &#x22;Gaston&#x22;. Of the new musical numbers &#x22;Evermore&#x22; and &#x22;How Does a
Moment Last Forever&#x22; were beautiful and fit well into the new version.
Emma Watson did a very good job as Belle. While her voice is not
Broadway quality is sweet and charming. I think Autotune has been
imagined on it because the media has told people it was there in the
trailers. Dan Stevens as the Beast is very powerful and manages to give
Beast life under all the CGI. The supporting cast (especially Luke
Evans, Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, and Emma Thompson) are all very good.
The cast doing the voice parts also infuse life into their characters
with their vocal performances. Despite his concerns about his French
accent McGregor did a brilliant job with his role. Emma Thompson gave a
pleasant rendition of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;.While the film is reverent to the 1991 film it should be taken as its
own entity. I highly recommend this film for family viewing. It is a
beautiful, joyful experience.

This is the Bill Condon adaptation of the Disney animated classic from
1991. Let me repeat that this is a live action adaption OF A CLASSIC! I
have read many reviews complaining about its lack of originality but im
here to say that why would we want to change a story that is so dear to
many a heart. This movie is a fantastic viewing for children and adult
alike. though i recognize that it is not perfect.The acting roles were also done masterfully but with some questions in
my humble opinion. i thought everyone except emma watson as belle fit
perfectly. ESPECIALLY GASTON! Luke evans stole the show for me. a big
surprise was josh gad as lefou because it was brilliant. josh gad did a
great job. all voice acting was superb and made it grand to be a guest
for their show.this movie holds dear to the story while also adding depth to pretty
much all the characters and even surprisingly giving depth to LeFou.
Some songs have been added which definitely did add to the story
beautifully. This movie feels very much like a musical due to the
increase of songs within the movie so it does feel like they sing way
more then in the animated.This movie was a very satisfying cinematic experience with breath
taking visuals from the beast to the castle and everything in between.
sets were absolutely gorgeous and every shot of this movie is a
beautiful master piece. and equally as beautiful is the heart that is
added through background stories mainly of beast and learning more
about belles mother which we learn very little about in the animated.overall this movie was an awesome viewing for me being a whole life fan
of the animated classic and i feel this only made it even better by
adding more to love that fits so perfectly. it is a beautiful viewing
so go see it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A very pleasant experience<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
If you loved the original animated film or if you love the Broadway
production, then I think you&#x27;ll end up enjoying this production as
well. One thing I really liked is that this film provided some more
backstory on the curse and filled in some spots the original never made
clear. The cast is also very good and they fit their roles well. The
singing is also good. Emma&#x27;s voice isn&#x27;t as strong as the others but it
was nice anyway. And of course the costumes were beautiful (although
not as outstanding as Cinderella was). But the production design was
gorgeous and would be a shame if it didn&#x27;t get an academy award
nomination next year.With a couple of minor changes, it does pretty much follow the route as
the animated movie practically beat for beat. Although one change I
thought was kind of unnecessary/silly was making the Belle the
inventor. Its not like it added anything to the story or having Maurice
be an artist add anything different but they also barely even focused
on it. They show her make one thing and its never referenced again. Not
even in Beast&#x27;s castle is she seen working on something. At least in
the animated movie, it served a purpose by making the townspeople
already think of Maurice as kind of kooky (and therefore unbelievable
when he comes back to tell them of the beast). Plus, one of his
inventions actually helps Belle escape from the basement. Here, it
literally doesn&#x27;t add anything.I saw it in a theater with a bunch of kids present and I heard giggles
of delight from them, so I think it will be a hit with them. Overall, I
enjoyed it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Above average movie, leads/songs are great, just doesn&#x27;t feel as &#x22;magical&#x22; as the 1991 classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
***WARNING: This review may contain spoilers***The movie is nice but doesn&#x27;t feel magical. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I like
the movie. Here&#x27;s what I think worked and didn&#x27;t.WHAT DID WORK: 1) I like the additions of backstory to the Beast&#x27;s and
Belle&#x27;s mother stories. 2) The new songs were good. Belle&#x27;s solo, the
Beast&#x27;s solo (showing him as a kid looking at his mother), and when the
Beast was up on the tower after he released Belle to go back to her
father 3) The more life-like movements of the candelabra and the clock
4) The Beast being Belle&#x27;s &#x22;book&#x22; equal instead of being uneducated in
the 1991 film 5) Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, and Luke Evans are good
leads 6) The part where all the servants in their &#x22;cursed state&#x22;
(dresser, candelabra, Mrs. Potts, Chip, the piano, and especially the
leg rest / dog become immobilized (and practically dead) was truly
emotional and done very well. 7) I actually liked the end credits (no
surprise scene at end) 8) Nice to hear Celine Dion sing during the end
credits (but I&#x27;m partial to her voice)WHAT DIDN&#x27;T WORK: 1) They did a Brandy Cinderella-type version with
town folk being white and black and multi-cultured...which made it look
like a modern movie set instead of a fairy tale 2) Bad CGI for the
wolves and the Beast&#x27;s face 3) The Village people reuniting with the
&#x22;new&#x22; reformed castle at the end and realizing there are some
relationships that were crisscrossed with each other 4)Emma Watson&#x27;s
songs were partially auto-tuned 5)Biggest disappointment for me was the
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;-song and the dance. That was the scene that
&#x22;made&#x22; the 1991 movie, but the way the whole scene was filmed did not
make it seem magical. I was waiting for the scene where Beast escorts
Belle into the dance floor (which was imitated in the movie
&#x22;Enchanted&#x22;--but nothing like that here. Unfortunately, it was
regrettable and more people are talking about Emma Watson&#x27;s yellow
dress than this scene. There are more things that worked and more things that didn&#x27;t work, but
these are some to give you an idea.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great movie but the cast could have been better<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This film could have easily been an 8.5 but unfortunately this could
not be. Emma Watson was not the best actor for sweet, friendly,
enthusiastic Belle. From the beginning of the movie Belle seemed so....
distant, cold, dull, boring. She was nothing like Belle from the
animated classic at all. Emma Watson was definitely not for this role
and its very disappointing. And oh my goodness--- Emma&#x27;s singing and
the drastic attempt to fix her singing with effects. That was horrible!
I noticed that the sound was... off during singing. How easy is it to
find a Belle that has an upbeat attitude, is pretty and sings really
well? These days they rather cast famous actors for the role, rather
than the best actor for the role--- to make more money. The film
suffers for this.Other than the Emma Watson disappointment (since shes the main
character) the graphics could have been better. The beast looked too
fake. I know that they could have made it more believable.Overall, I loved the movie because it reminded me of the good old days.P.S. I think the Prince looked better as the beast. Lol. Seriously.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Best live-action so far<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty &#x26; the Beast - We find ourselves with yet another live-action
Disney remake. These have been hit or miss for me so far, with
Maleficent being the worst example of their recent retellings. In
watching the trailers for Beauty &#x26; the Beast, I was finding myself let
down more and more with each one. If Maleficent was the CTRL + ALT +
DLT of its original story, this was shaping up to be just a Copy/Paste.
I had cooled on the idea of seeing it, but then I remembered- I review
movies. ;)Right out of the gate the movie is every bit its predecessor, but it
does eventually find opportunities to offer unique moments. After all
is said and done it ends up being an excellent blend old and new.Of the old, it has word for word exchanges from the original, with even
some of the same blocking. The characters transfer over seamlessly and
it had the same grand moments with &#x27;Be Our Guest&#x27; and the ballroom
dance scene. I do have to say, however, that the dance from the
original still takes the cake. The way the camera was sweeping around,
in a cartoon mind you, was just something that had never been seen
before.Of the new, we&#x27;re introduced to two more songs this time around. I
thought the Beast&#x27;s new solo was incredible and I played it again when
I got home. The movie of course is mostly live-action, but there are
quite a few CGI-only scenes peppered in. I was impressed with all of
the animations, except for the Beast himself. While the other elements
seemed to have weight to them, his face felt very cartoonish and flat.
With how the Jungle Book excelled in its animation, this felt like a
bit of a step back.Obviously there was all the commotion about Lefou before the movie came
out. I&#x27;m not sure why they felt it necessary to do a press release
about it rather than just having the character be who he was, but it
was of course fine. About as subtle as a hammer, but fine. And if you
thought the original Lefou didn&#x27;t hold a torch for Gaston, you might
want to watch it again.Beauty &#x26; the Beast has all the &#x27;feels&#x27; of the original and then some.
The music is a major part of that, but the fact that all of the actors
showed up with their A-game contributed as well. But if you want to go
see it and then try to tell me you didn&#x27;t like it- be my guest :)
8.5/10.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>LeFou Finds Prince Charming<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast, a tale as old as time. A long beloved and
somewhat controversial fairy tale that not everyone was willing to see
made live. Disney is still at the beginning of their phase of remaking
classics into live action films, with Beauty and the Beast being the
third (I believe) that is just a remake as opposed to a new take, after
Cinderella and the Jungle Book. Everyone knows the story: a prince (Dan
Stevens) is cursed to be a beast until he finds true love, and an
opportunity arises when a smart, different girl (Emma Watson) enters
his castle. The new, evolved story answers some questions that the
animated version left open ended, like what happened to Belle&#x27;s mother,
what happened to Beast&#x27;s parents, and more details about the
enchantress&#x27;s magic on the castle. The Beast is earned some sympathy
with a backstory, yet is it also covered why he got himself cursed,
being a selfish, rude prince as opposed to just an orphaned eleven year
old turning an old lady away at the door. Belle is evolved to be a
modern woman in an olden time. She is the inventor, instead of her
father, who is an artist. She attempts to teach a young girl to read,
which the village sees as absurd and unnecessary. She actually gives
the village a reason to despise her. She is also more headstrong and
determined, trying to escape when captured at first. The move itself is dazzling and charming. From the very beginning, the
sets and costumes are to be admired. It captures you in a fairy tale.
The musical scenes are cartoony yet beautiful, simply an animated world
come to life. The castle and its inhabitants are a display of the
talent in the design team behind the movie. It takes a bit of getting
used to, with Cogsworth and Lumiere redesigned into more elegant
furniture pieces, and Mrs. Potts and the Wardrobe looking nearly
unrecognizable from their previous designs. Seeing the beast more
humanized was weird and I am not sure if it was the right choice. It
kind of eliminated the whole &#x27;looking past horrifying&#x27; when he was
basically just a large, hairy man with horns. The movie allowed time for Belle and Beast to actually know each other
and become friends and form a relationship before they fell in love.
Beast is also a bookworm in this version, already having the giant
library as opposed to just getting it to win over Belle, leading to a
more genuine relationship. The performances were cartoony, as to be
expected. They are portraying animated characters, so everyone knows
their acting would be a bit, well, animated. If you are either avoiding or praising this for it&#x27;s &#x22;exclusively gay
moment&#x22; featuring Josh Gad&#x27;s character, LeFou, I wouldn&#x27;t hold your
breath. LeFou, Gaston&#x27;s little friend, is obviously infatuated with
him. This is mostly for comedic purposes, however. Later in the movie,
when the villagers are storming the castle, the wardrobe puts three men
who are attacking her in dresses. Two of them go screaming, while one
is very happy dressed up like that. In the finale, him and LeFou are
ballroom dancing together for a split second. If you blink, you miss
it. LeFou also gets redemption after Gaston turns him away one too many
times. A few new songs are added to the new version to fit in new parts
of the story. Obviously not as good as the original songs, and largely
forgettable, however. As someone who loved the animated movie and princess Belle growing up,
I was happy with the remake. It captured most of the same magic and
made me smile. If you&#x27;re upset that this &#x27;remake theater&#x27; is what
Disney has chosen to do, that is fine, but do not regard it as a bad
movie just because of that.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It actually impressed me<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;ll start by saying this. &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is one of my favorite
Disney movies ever. Probably only second to Mulan. Of course, I always
enjoy the singing, but what I enjoyed most were the characters,
especially Cogsworth, Lumiere, and Mrs. Potts. I loved the dynamic
between them and the Beast. And concerning the Beast, I was always
impressed with Robbie Benson&#x27;s ability to go from gruff and feral to
sweet and gentle.When I went to see this movie, I was cautiously optimistic; I didn&#x27;t
want one of my favorite childhood movies to be ruined. It was actually
better than I was expecting it to be. It will never be the 1991 movie,
but I still managed to get a lot out of the film.My biggest qualm with this movie was Emma Watson. I love her to death,
but I can&#x27;t say that I enjoyed her singing too much. I was perfectly
happy with the acting, but I think it would&#x27;ve been better to dub the
singing parts with an actual singer or to have just cast a better
singer. The quality of her singing versus that of others was starkly
apparent. Other than that, I loved seeing her again.The movie&#x27;s also missing that back-and-forth banter between Lumiere and
Cogsworth. There&#x27;s some of it in there, but it&#x27;s not nearly as funny as
it was in the animated movie.Now for the good stuff. I&#x27;m so glad that they brought Alan Menken back
because he did it again! Even 20 years later, he manages to make such
terrific songs. It&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m pretty fond of the old songs, but the
new ones are simply to good to ignore.A lot of the stuff from the 1991 movie is in this one. There are also
some new scenes that sort of give you a little more insight into
certain characters. Lefou is certainly more respectable here than he is
in the animated movie and seems much less deserving of his name.I thought the CGI was pretty good with maybe the possible exception of
the Beast. He didn&#x27;t look horrible, but I wish he&#x27;d looked different.
Certain features of his looked odd at times. Like his legs. They looked
a little too big to me. But the CGI in &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;? That was
amazing! A very entertaining show! I&#x27;m glad that I saw this. I was having doubts, even while sitting in
the movie theater, but I was very happy with what I&#x27;d seen when I left.

Beautifully done film! No complaints from me. Where there a few flaws?
Yes, but I am one that can overlook that. I enjoyed all the actors. The
stand outs for me where Luke Evans, Josh Gad, and Kevin Kline.
Definitely a fun family film and I look forward to Disney&#x27;s other live
action movies.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>careful spoiler ahead!! Great movie just the like original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
i went into this with low hope because of the ratings i had seen for
the week. but watching the movie really brought back childish memories
of watching this move serval times in many different way, including
animated and copy cats versions. This move was a lot like the original
version just live action and with every thing more realistic. they had
did add some stuff to story line but not to much to make the storyline
different. But overall good movie and hope diner keeps up the good work
on these remake of animated classic movies.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>New and a bit alarming<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When I checked the reviews for this movie I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes,
you&#x27;d think by the looks of them this movie would have a 1/10 rating at
best. It disturbed me to the point where I felt like making an account
and writing my own review, in hopes that perhaps people won&#x27;t turn away
from this great movie after reading all these hate-filled essays.To start, I do want to point out that I agree with the criticism in one
aspect: Emma Watson. She&#x27;s certainly not Belle, or a good actress
overall for that matter. This is coming from someone who&#x27;s obsessed
with the Harry Potter movies, and even then I couldn&#x27;t tolerate her.
She&#x27;s the same character in all her movies, and that is Emma Watson. I
saw someone comparing her to Kristen Stewart in terms of bland acting
and just being bland in general, and I second that.That being said, she didn&#x27;t &#x22;ruin&#x22; the movie. In fact, I saw past all
of that because there were many other things to focus on and enjoy.
Beautiful scenes and decoration, great acting (Josh Gad, Luke Evans,
Kevin Kline), the enchanted objects are much funnier and more appealing
than the original movie&#x27;s, there&#x27;s chemistry between the actors, good
directing, and most importantly: I love the added songs and character
insights. We get to know more about the characters and many questions
that were left unanswered in the original are answered in this one. I wasn&#x27;t even a big fan of the original and I only went to see it
because I love Disney, and I was in for a delightful surprise. The CGI isn&#x27;t on the Jungle Book level per se, but it&#x27;s not bad. The
only thing that might tick you is the beast&#x27;s face animation but not to
the point of NOT getting over it as the movie goes. Most importantly: this is still a children&#x27;s movie. You can&#x27;t critique
it as if you went in there expecting the depth of the Godfather. From
what I can tell, it served its target audience more than fine. &#x22;This is a copy of the original movie!&#x22; If it wasn&#x27;t, there would be
criticism over it NOT sticking to the original story. &#x22;The story is
about a wealthy beast who only gets love because he&#x27;s wealthy!&#x22; OK, why
weren&#x27;t these complaints present in the original movie? Not to mention
that this is a *fairy tale*. &#x22;Too much singing!&#x22; There are movies where
there are barely any spoken words (ie Les Miserables, Evita) but this
isn&#x27;t one of them, it has a reasonable amount of songs for a musical.
&#x22;The original didn&#x27;t even need a remake!&#x22; And that&#x27;s your opinion, but
a lot of people do want live-action remakes, hence why they&#x27;re made. A
remake can never do any harm to the original movie, in fact if a remake
is bad it will only make you like the original movie even better.I gave this movie 10 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed it. Hell, I
can&#x27;t wait for more live- action remakes!

Ever since I heard about the news about a live action adaptation of
this Disney classic I was over the moon. I was even more excited to
hear Emma Watson was going to play Belle. I&#x27;m a big fan of her and will
watch any of her work. There was still a bit of cautiousness about this
adaptation. The animated musical is my favorite Disney film of all time
and it was completely possible to be disappointed because of it not
holding up to the 1991 version. Now having seen it I must say this film
was great. If you are a fan of the animated film I think you wont be
let down by this very faithful re-imagining.I&#x27;ll start with the negatives if they can even be called that. I think
the CGI Beast looked odd and off at times, especially around the face.
Dan Stevens is completely unrecognizable but still some of the Beast
scenes have a slight hindrance of looking computerized. Some of the
same could be said with the facial expressions on Mrs. Potts and Chip.
This qualm is really minimal though, it must be hard bringing a talking
beast and talking teacup to life so this is barely a criticism. The
film is quite long, the animated classic is basically spread out with
even more songs and scenes between Belle and The Beast. Its not really
bad as it doesn&#x27;t really take away from the fantastical experience. The
Beauty and the Beast main theme was kind of disappointing. Emma
Thompson did a nice job but the song doesn&#x27;t compare to the Angela
Lansbury version which is supreme. Lastly, the castle design should
have followed the animated version more closely, in my opinion.The production and set design is fabulous. I&#x27;m sure a lot of the scenes
were computerized however it all looks great. The scene of Belle
singing up on to the hills early on in the film looks magnificent. The
castle and costume design is on point. The costumes especially bring
the animated characters to life. There is so much going on on screen
and your eyes are captivated by it all. I&#x27;m talking especially about
the &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; song, its absolutely spectacular. The music is also
great and for the most part faithfully re-recorded and completely
respects the songs in the Disney classic.People were complaining about Emma Watson portraying Belle. I think she
may put a lot of the critics to rest now. She handles the Belle
character with grace, beauty, and a strong willing persuasion. Every
scene I felt like the animated Belle came to life. Dan Stevens and Ewan
McGregor voice (and motion capture I guess) were great. Luke Evans was
an MVP as the brash, cocky, and downright jerky Gaston. The cast all
did a great job of bringing their counterparts to life. I was hesitant
about Bill Condon helming the film but now am glad that he did.This was a very faithful live update to the animated film from 1991.
There are more songs and space for characters to grow and
cinematography to pop but its all very respectful to its predecessor.
Overall, if you are a die-hard fan of the animated version I think you
will love it. Its a wonderful new addition (and perhaps the strongest
one yet) to the live action Disney remake trend. Its a bright and
profitable future if these first crop of films are any indication of
whats to come.8.5/10

Beauty and the Beast is Disney&#x27;s latest live action remake of one of
their animated classics. But unlike Jungle Book, Maleficent, and from
what I&#x27;ve heard, Cinderella, which gave us new spins on familiar
stories, Disney opted to make this movie a scene by scene remake of the
original. With excellent production values and a high caliber cast that
includes Dan Stevens, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, and Ewan McGregor,
Disney certainly delivered an entertaining family film, but it is too
similar to the animated movie to really stand out in any way. The story is unchanged - a mean, selfish prince is cursed by an
Enchantress and transformed into a beast until he can learn to love -
and someone loves him back. All hope seems lost until a beautiful,
intelligent woman named Bell finds his castle in search of her father,
who the beast has imprisoned. You can guess what happens next if you
don&#x27;t know.This Beauty and the Beast is about thirty minutes longer than the
original. The extra scenes do provide some interesting background
information and resolve some plot holes from the original movie, which
is appreciated. But other subplots just fall flat. A subplot about
Belle&#x27;s mother and LaFou (Gaston&#x27;s buddy) don&#x27;t really go anywhere.
There are also four new songs here and I can&#x27;t say I can remember a
single one of them.The cast is mostly excellent. Luke Evans is a funny Gaston and Kevin
Kline is good as Bell&#x27;s father. Dan Stevens also gives the Beast
emotional depth. Unfortunately the weakest link in the cast is the most
important part - Belle. I don&#x27;t understand how Emma Watson continues to
find work - she&#x27;s a complete bore as an actress and the auto tune for
her singing is really obvious. She&#x27;s good enough, but her love scenes
with the Beast aren&#x27;t convincing. They feel like they are going through
the motions. Even the special effects are a mixed bag. The Beast&#x27;s facial
expressions and movements are not as convincing as they should be.
While the living household objects are animated well, they are almost
too realistic, which robs them of the character they had in the
animated movie. This Beauty and the Beast is a good film to take your kids to, but it
ultimately represents the worst trends in Hollywood nowadays. It&#x27;s
afraid of taking risks and it exploits nostalgia for cash. I can
understand why they didn&#x27;t want to change too much of the original,
given that it&#x27;s arguably their best animated film, but that just begs
the question - did this need to be made? I think the answer is no.

Omg!! This film is amazing!!! So underrated it&#x27;s the best Disney film
since years!!! Belle is such a young empowering woman and the beast
tells us to never judge anyone by looks. But the film is so visually
stunning, and even though I&#x27;m a massive Marvel fan, &#x22;Logan&#x22; was great
but &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is just so unique, charming and so cute!!! I
adore the character LeFou being gay because it can boost self-esteem
for the LGBT community and the fact he kissed Gaston?? Wow. I really
enjoyed the film!! I mean I would give it 10 but the CGI sort of ruins
it. It was rather weak. I can&#x27;t wait for more live-action Disney films
because this is the best film after the Sheshawnk Redemption.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Did You Really Expect It To Be As Good As 1991&#x27;s Version?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
1991&#x27;s adaptation of Beauty &#x26; the Beast is my favourite animated film.
I honestly do think it is the best ever. No disrespect to Toy Story or
Snow White, but the 1991 classic has such beauty and raw power that has
an undeniably strong emotional impact. Sure there have been other
adaptations of Beauty and the Beast, but none of which was a remake of
the cartoon. When I found out that a live-action version of the cartoon
would be made, I was thrilled. My favourite animated film ever is being
made with real people! The Jungle Book and Cinderella are the recent
live-action versions of Disney classic and they soared high. Okay maybe
I&#x27;m babbling, so I&#x27;ll get to the point: 2017&#x27;s live- action version of
the beloved Beauty and the Beast is good but not great.Emma Watson dons the role of Belle. She was good, but not great. In
fact, she may be the worst cast in this. Dan Stevens is almost perfect
as Beast. For the costume he gets, there was no getting better. Luke
Evans is pretty awesome as Gaston (I think that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s spelled).
Josh Gad was great as his sidekick. And Kevin Kline was wonderful as
Belle&#x27;s father, Maurice. But how well do these character&#x27;s mesh with
everything else?In the first little bit, Belle is popular and Gaston wants to marry
her. The movie takes off when Maurice stumbles into the Beast&#x27;s castle.
Honestly, the whole chunk before that isn&#x27;t all that special. The
beautiful scenery and looks are what carry it...and the whole movie.
This first bit didn&#x27;t seem to have the joy and spirit that the 90&#x27;s
version had. It&#x27;s rather bland. It doesn&#x27;t suck, it just doesn&#x27;t have
much of a reaction on the viewer. When Maurice winds up at Beast&#x27;s castle, he becomes his prisoner. Belle
rescues him and she takes his place. Now the movie is taking off and
we&#x27;re at the point where the cool things happen. All of the
animatronics of the accessories were sweet and the castle itself looks
wonderful. And of course, everybody&#x27;s a sucker for the romance between
Belle and Beast. The only flaws were that the magic was lost. The
little furniture things were cool but not awesome, the scenery wasn&#x27;t
enchanting or glamorous, and it was all too dark. I was expecting the
look to be as enchanting as the live-action version of Cinderella from
2015. This one got lucky a few times, such as (obviously) the &#x22;Tale As
Old As Time&#x22; scene. In terms of looks, that Cinderella wins. The other stuff that deals with Gaston is rather generic. When him and
the town&#x27;s people invade the castle, it is the battle between him and
Beast that is actually the worst part of that scene. There was nothing
special or intense about it like the cartoon had. With all this
upgraded technology, they should have made it as awesome as the
cartoon! But whatever, the payoff when Beast and all the objects turn
back into humans is wonderful. So the movie doesn&#x27;t have the magic or charm that the 1991 cartoon had.
So the pacing was off (almost fifty minutes were added, a simple
fifteen or twenty would have been enough). So it was dark. The movie
still has stuff going for it. The imagery is beautiful, the romance is
strong, the music is fine, etc. Maybe they&#x27;re not at the level of the
old one, but this still does almost all those well enough. And the
flaws I listed are reasons this movie wasn&#x27;t totally fantastic and why
I may not call it one of the year&#x27;s best. Nonetheless, I recommend it. It&#x27;s hard not to compare, but this is too
good to ignore.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful and not beastly!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Those of us &#x27;of a certain age&#x27; will remember the original animation of
Beauty and the Beast, either because we were children, or, as in my
case, had a child who watched it on repeat on Video. So to say I am
very familiar with the original Disney Animation is an understatement.Imagine my dismay at the thought of a REAL PERSON attempting to become&#x85;
Gaston. I mean nearly any &#x27;starlet&#x27; today could do a passable Belle,
but Gaston, no this guy had to be something special, because Gaston is
the driving force of the film; Gaston is the Donald Trump of Disney.
Now I may sound biased (Luke Evans is Welsh) by saying that after
seeing the film, I really can&#x27;t imagine anyone else playing that part,
and I&#x27;m unfamiliar with Josh Gadd, but he made a perfect foil to Evans&#x27;
bull headed, misogynistic oaf by being subtly gay, gay enough to get
banned in Russia, but subtle enough to make their friendship plausible.
Evans really is something to behold, handsome yet despicable, he oozes
sex appeal yet still managed to make me frown with disgust. In fact I
would be so bold as to say the casting in this film is spot on. Emma
Watson is quite delightful as Belle, nor once did she ram feminism down
our throats, and her singing voice was sweetly&#x85;okay. She was in fact
perfect as Belle, sweet and not OVER Feisty, but gave a real-feel to
her character as a woman who had the choice of never marrying or ending
up as the probable punch-bag of the village idiot. Dan Stevens, who I
assume was Mo-capped, gave depth to the Beast, despite his face being
covered in hair (how dare he! And... OMG that face Isn&#x27;t real?) Could
also sing. Kevin Kline played her dad with a wistful longing and Ewan
McGregor and Sir Ian McKellan made a good double act as Lumiere and
Cogsworth. (Dame) Emma Thompson was of course perfect (as she is
perfect in everything), and special Kudos to Stanley Tucci for being
his usual over the top magnificent self. The visuals are really quite
lovely and contrary to a lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read, the Beast&#x27;s face
wasn&#x27;t fuzzy (no pun intended) and did not detract OR distract from my
enjoyment of the film - In fact I have no idea why people are saying
that! He&#x27;s supposed to be a Beast, therefore he would have a fuzzy
hairy face. The REAL star of this film is of course the songs. All of
the original Howard Elliot Ashman and Alan Menken tunes are included,
with 2 new tunes with Lyrics by Tim Rice. And what crowd pleasing rip
snorting songs they are too. Not once did I yawn with boredom or wish
they&#x27;d hurry up and finish, nope, in fact I sang. Out loud (luckily it
was very loud in the cinema and the other 20 old women in there - with
husbands &#x96; I&#x27;d like to think they were singing too). The set piece for
&#x27;Gaston&#x27; (with original longer and more &#x27;adult&#x27; lyrics by Menken is a
rollicking ride I defy anyone not to want to stamp their feet too, and
the centerpiece of &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; as the couple finally dance
together in the ballroom is everything I wanted it to be. Thompson&#x27;s
Mrs Potts wobbly voice singing the most romantic of lyrics. I admit a
may have got something in my eye as Beast Twirled Belle in her yellow
gown across the floor. Sigh. Now I&#x27;ve read several reviews of B&#x26;TB on
IMDb, mainly from American cinema goers, who have resoundingly slated
it. The consensus is that it&#x27;s boring and not a patch on the original.
Personally I was a little worried that it would be, like the other
Disney live-actions, too &#x27;right on&#x27; a bit too &#x27;different&#x27; from the
original and also include a load of overt feminist doctrine that&#x85; has a
place of course, but maybe not to prove a point. While the feminism in
this film IS there and is subtle (&#x27;why are you teaching that girl to
read? Isn&#x27;t one enough&#x27; and the fact that Gaston can&#x27;t believe Belle
doesn&#x27;t want him, mm perhaps that&#x27;s sexist in itself?) it could have
been a very different film. What Disney have finally done is, get it
completely right. Because all they&#x27;ve done is tweak is slightly. It is
a near carbon copy of a much loved film. So why bother making it again?
A good question, one I have only one answer for and that of course, is
money. I&#x27;m certainly not complaining, even the end credits are
beautiful. I would have been more than happy to have popped to the loo,
sat back down and re-watched the whole magical wonderful film again.
Okay I&#x27;ll tell you a secret. In my heart I am Belle, Snow White,
Aurora, Cinderella, Mowgli and even Dumbo. THAT is the secret of Disney
Films, because most little girls and some boys and lots of transgender
people want to be a Princess, and be loved. So for all the people on
IMDb who hate this film&#x85; NER to you. The world we live in at the
moment, I&#x27;ll take some fairy tale magic romance any day!! &#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;Tale as
old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the beast&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;.PS I cried at the end.

Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!! They live happily ever after.Pros: The female lead is girl-next-door pretty. The CGI is at times
fantastic even though The Beast looks photo-shopped at times. The songs
you love are there. The number in the tavern is pretty darn good. The
numbers involving the talking non-human objects are very
entertaining.The theater was full of hot suburban moms...you know the
term. Small children will like it though I think there are times when
it will be too violent for anyone under the age of 10.Cons: The first musical number in the village just doesn&#x27;t work.
Everyone comes across as trying too hard. The songs you hate are there.
This isn&#x27;t nearly as good as Jungle Book....not even close. The movie
is way too long. The obvious man-crush that the lead bad guy&#x27;s personal
assistant has is just way too obvious and intentionally so. It become a
central plot device. I know, it is a PC/economic decision. Disney wants
to draw in as many bodies as possible. Inclusiveness sells.I left disappointed but my wife enjoyed it. Small children cheered.
Their mothers wanted to get home to start drinking. Dad&#x27;s peace and
quite was coming to an end.

&#x22;Beauty and The Beast&#x22; is a Live-Action Disney Adaptation of the
beloved 90&#x27;s Disney classic Animated Movie of the same name based on
the French Fairy tale &#x22;La Belle et la B&#xEA;te&#x22; in the 1700&#x27;s. The Original
Disney Movie is a timeless movie that is now another Disney Live-
Adaption along with Cinderella, Jungle Book, and Pete&#x27;s Dragon. The
Movie is Directed by Bill Condon, the same mad man who directed a
couple of Twilight movies, well my expectations just flew out the roof!
But this is a movie review, so let&#x27;s talk about the movie, it&#x27;s pretty
good. Beauty and the Beast follows most of the original Disney story
while making a few changes that I mildly Disagreed with. But the
direction was still impressive with the fantastic journey of Belle, a
bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by
a beast in his castle. Despite her fears, she befriends the castle&#x27;s
enchanted staff and learns to look beyond the Beast&#x27;s hideous exterior
and realize the kind heart and soul of the true Prince within. The CGI
is truly spectacular to see, and the effects and environments felt as
similar as the original which made it feel just as appealing. The
appliance characters still reminded me of what they truly are in
appearance and performance. The one thing that got me though is the
dead-eyed expressions of some of them like the teapot and cogsworth The
Acting is amazing to watch with the musical performances magical and
outstanding to see with the same scenes. Emma Watson plays Belle and
leaves me impressed with how she executed the performance. Dan Stevens
Beast was truly impressive with how he provided anger and emotion
within the acting. Luke Evans as Gaston was the best, he is perfect for
the role and made it great as making him Scary yet Comedic. The one
things I have ups and downs about is the new changes it made. In the
original, Beast&#x27;s character was portrayed as a dumbed character as he
didn&#x27;t know how to read or have manners, With this in mind, this gives
Belle a better reason to trust him since of teachings to him. In the
new version, Beast was shown to be more brighter with him owning an
entire library mentioning how their in Greek. And with this in mind, we
see how they can have a close relationship when Beast shows how much he
has more of a minded self, even one scene he quotes Shakespeare. They
also managed to bring back most songs like be our guest and the Gaston
song, but also showing us new songs. Watching the new songs has more of
a classic Disney feel to it including &#x22;Evermore,&#x22; a sympathy song for
beast after Belle leaves the castle to save her father from the town,
that was great though, i loved Steven&#x27;s voice. Another concept that was
brought was when Beast dies near the end when Belle is next to him
crying, which still makes me sad in both movies. In the original, we
never got to see what happened to them during that part, so they
brought it in this one. They split both acts with Beast dying to an
scene when we watch the appliances slowly turn into regular antiques
which really made me feel emotional in a theater. And when the curse is
broken the appliances turn back to humans along with the Beast which
was still heartfelt Overall, Beauty and the Beast was a pretty
impressive that I didn&#x27;t mind watching because it is a colorful and
fantastically executed movie despite the changes. The acting is
outstanding and decent to watch with the characters being likable and
dramatic. The CGI is truly visual magic still having it&#x27;s Jungle Book
scenery flare, I thought was impressive. This movie is beautiful, well
acted, and a introduce us a marvelous story. B+
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Visually appealing, amazing soundtrack, etc.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I originally had very low expectations for this movie. Unlike a lot of
other people, I actually really enjoyed the song previews by Emma
Watson. But the visuals didn&#x27;t seem close enough to the original.
However, seeing the movie today I was proved wrong. There were a few
visual aspects that I questioned, such as Mrs. Potts and Chip, but
thinking about it, it would actually be incredibly hard to convert the
original animated movie into a live action movie. The film was
incredibly well executed considering how well-loved the original is. I
was speechless around halfway through the movie. I could sympathize
with the Beast incredibly well. The audience was given more of the
Beast&#x27;s history which made the character development and relatability
so much more effective. In regards to Mrs. Potts and Chip, I thought
the character animation was really awkward and the design was subpar
compared to the other characters. Plumette (Lumi&#xE8;re&#x27;s love interest),
was also incredibly odd. The way that she could fly maybe made sense in
order for her to move, but she looked more alive than the others
considering the fact she was based off of a bird. I originally believed
that the Beast&#x27;s appearance looked far too kind to be considered
frightening, or beastly. But as the film progressed I noticed the
emotion in the eyes especially that makes the Beast more human and
therefore more relatable. The music was delightful, very emotional and
included original songs as well as the music from the 1991 movie. In
addition, a lot of the mistakes made in the 1991 version were fixed. I
noticed that the actions of the characters were a lot more believable
and realistic. A lot of the content in the original movie was slightly
unrealistic, and so the change was refreshing, especially since it made
it different from the other film and not an exact copy. Overall, the
movie was incredible and definitely worth seeing in theaters.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Neither Horrible nor Satisfying<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Please Disney.. That was the best shot you could give to a movie like
this? It was really promising but nah, i was so disappointed. You could
have done much more. Some lines from the original should not have been
cut. I knew it would not be the same but come on! There were some smart
lines and i liked the new way of Belle interacting with the Beast but i
really missed the animated dance scene. the way that Belle shows to the
Beast how to dance again was something else, i really missed it. Also,
i didn&#x27;t like the new version of Plumette. It was awful. The actors
were good but nothing so special, apart from Gaston. Also HUGE
DISAPPOINTMENT when Beast gains his human form again. Seriously you
could have done something better with his hair. Also, when Belle
leaves, the Beast is supposed to be sad not dancing and singing like he
is happy. I really missed the magic of the animated movie. Lastly, as
BBC wrote &#x22;If it ain&#x27;t broke, do not remake it&#x22;

I absolutely loved this adaption of Beauty and the Beast, and I simply
can&#x27;t understand all the negativity? This ties up so many questions I had after watching the animated
version, and is just simply spectacular. I recommend anybody planning
on watching this to just go in with an open-mind.Emma Watson is a gorgeous Belle, and I especially loved Josh Gad as Le
Fou.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Attractive new Beauty still pales next to the original classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney&#x27;s new and improved &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; has lots going for it. The beast&#x27;s voice (as rumbled by Dan Stevens) is perfect, as is Ewan
MacGregor&#x27;s Lumiere and Ian McKellan&#x27;s Cogsworth. In fact, the whole
cast is attractive, engaging and surprisingly musical (who knew Luke
Evans could sing?). Speaking of music, the original songs are just as
good as you remember. There&#x27;s even a few additional numbers that, while
not spectacular, add color and depth to the story.Speaking of spectacle, the biggest Beauty in this version is the
production value. As I watched, every new scene had another gorgeous
set piece. The entire Disney stable was obviously working overtime and
it shows. Every chandelier is wrought with golden filigree, every
turret on the castle is weathered and majestic, every costume gleams
with ribbons and needlework. Even the horns of the beast are works of
art.I am also pleased to say that the story itself, is, aside from a few
minor additions, essentially identical to the original. This really is
the &#x27;tale as old as time&#x27; and nothing new could improve it. The
filmmakers made the right call here.With so many things going right for it, this new Beauty is
unfortunately missing one very important thing:Belle.Emma Watson isn&#x27;t Belle. She just isn&#x27;t. Even if you haven&#x27;t seen the
original it&#x27;s obvious that something is missing from our Disney
Heroine. On the surface Watson has everything we need. She&#x27;s beautiful.
She&#x27;s plucky. She can sing, she can dance - heck, she&#x27;s even
comfortable on horseback.With all those boxes checked, you&#x27;d think the movie would soar - and
there are moments when it lifts off. But multiple times I found myself
pulled out of the experience by Watson&#x27;s disconnection. Unfortunately,
she is only partially engaged with the character and so we cannot fall
completely in love.Now, to be fair, I&#x27;ve heard critics say Watson is only marginally
talented and I would disagree. Her version of Sam was the reason Perks
of Being a Wallflower is a millennial classic - and let&#x27;s be honest,
could you imagine anyone else as Hermione? No, I don&#x27;t think her talent
is in question. I&#x27;m honestly not exactly sure what happened. It&#x27;s
possible that acting against a digital actor was too difficult. It&#x27;s
also possible that with a giant studio movie like this there were too
many cooks in the kitchen. Regardless, Emma Watson&#x27;s uneven performance
is the major weakness of the film.If you loved the original you&#x27;re obviously going to see this version -
and you should. It&#x27;s beautiful, enjoyable and you&#x27;ll leave the theatre
singing some of the best Disney music of all time. But I&#x27;m willing to
bet you&#x27;ll also have a stronger urge to see the cartoon version, and
perhaps that was the point of this remake all along. The 1991 Disney
film remains one of the best movies ever made.Three stars (out of four)

I&#x27;m no expert on CGI, but I do sing. This was my first 3D movie, which
was mostly fun, but a bit overwhelming in the crowd scenes. We were
fairly near the front of the theater thanks to having to
advance-purchase seats, so that was likely a factor. As soon as I heard
Audra McDonald&#x27;s voice, I was hooked. Emma Watson&#x27;s voice was fine,
while Dan Stevens voice was one of the most pleasant surprises of the
film. Kevin Kline added depth to Maurice&#x27;s gentle spirit, while Emma
Thompson&#x27;s characterization was comforting. Luke Evans&#x27; Gaston was less
air-headed, and seemed more cruel than either the animated or live
musical versions, so having Josh Gad as his side-kick was welcome comic
relief. The showcase numbers (Be Our Guest, for example) were well
done, and fun to experience. The more violent scenes are really not
appropriate for the youngest Belles; however, third-graders (maybe
second-grade) and older should be fine.Did it sparkle as much as the animated original? Perhaps not, but the
live actors gave it depth and nuance. I enjoyed this version, and would
see it again, even in 3D.

I watched Beauty and the Beast in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This
resulted in bright images projected by dual projectors on the giant 42
feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole
screen without chopping the picture. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX
proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!First of all, trailers are suppose to give you a teaser of the film,
not tell you the plot, so don&#x27;t watch the trailer at all. Next, I will
rate this better than Cinderella and well worth seeing in IMAX 3D,
considering the 3D is much better than Kong: Skull Island. Emma Watson
is perfect as Belle, I cannot imagine anyone else portraying her. I
love her acting and singing and could not take my eyes off her. The
cinematography is great, often springing right out of the animation and
the colors are dazzling. There is a lot to like about this movie, but
unfortunately it&#x27;s all the stuff we&#x27;ve seen before. My significant
digit score: 6.8/10P.S. I definitely can&#x27;t wait to visit Disneyland!

It was a beautiful movie, great colours, a fairly good cast and
beautiful meaning. I think Beauty and the Beast, are among the most
beloved movies of Disney, and they did a fairly good work in this
remake. Firsty Watson&#x27;s appearance was great, she had the role and she
gave a good performance. As for the rest of the cast, it was obvious
that it was well worked, nothing astonishing, but good enough. During
the movie I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the colours. They changed
beautifully as the mood changed, without it being very abrupt, or ugly.
The thing about the movie is the music, it felt like there were a lot
of music parts that could have been cut, at some points the movie was
getting quite boring because of them and it lost its point. I know part
of Disney is the music and I expected a lot of it, but it really was
too much. There weren&#x27;t enough dialogues, and I really don&#x27;t get why
isn&#x27;t it called a musical. To me this movie is a good one and I would
watch it again. Not for the performances, nor for the music. I would
watch it again because it really is a true beauty.

In a fairy tale village there is a &#x27;beauty&#x27; of a girl who is chased for
marriage but to no avail by a nasty villain with his right hand &#x27;man&#x27;
in tow..Whilst in a castle, a prince of sorts who failed to show compassion was
turned into a &#x27;beast&#x27; and made to live a life of misery unless true
love can release him from his torment.The girls&#x27; father plays a pivotal role in bringing the beauty and the
beast together....but will the villain prevent a happy conclusion?This movie has a lot of charm, being part musical, part pantomime, with
enough action, dance, comedy, costume elegance and positive political
correctness to make it successful.The show stoppers are the magnificent special effect ensemble of
personified &#x22;props&#x22; such as clock, tea cup, candelabra and wardrobe
that provide the character and charisma needed in this film.All in all this picture gives us a Disney infused high class fantasy,
worthy of a merit able 7 and a half, rounded up, hence: 8/10.

Visually a beautiful film, with great art direction. Soundtrack... I
have no words to describe ... The old songs really gave me an intense
nostalgic feeling and I really love the new songs.A cast with big names, which guaranteed not only good performances, but
also new perspectives on the characters. Ewan McGregor as the Lumiere
was good and fun. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, very good in their roles, the dynamics
between the two protagonists was good.Emma Thompson... wonderful. Luke Evans did a great job, especially in
the musical sequences. Kevin Kline who plays the father of the
beautiful, gave new perspective to his character who had changes from
the animated classic to this new movie.I love it.

I have absolutely no idea what these other salty critics have against
this movie, but don&#x27;t listen to any of them. This movie was stunning.
The animation put into this movie was astounding and they did a
wonderful job. The singing was great and the story was fantastic. They
picked a perfect cast for this movie! People were clapping after some

know you won&#x27;t regret it!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The best remake of a movie ever!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
If I had to give a description of this movie in one word, I would have
to say &#x22;Everything&#x22;. How could I choose just one word? This movie had a
perfect blend of effects and surprise, while remaining true to the
beloved film we are all familiar with. I was originally skeptical of
seeing it, due to the nature of remakes and them not being as wonderful
as the original, but this movie surprised me. Not only did the movie
blow my mind, the characters were all well cast and the attention of
detail really made this movie 100 times better. This movie was so
marvelous, I fail to see how any movie could ever compare to this. If
you have not seen the original, this movie will far outshine the
timeless classic it is made from. If you want to laugh, cry, sing, and
cheer; This is definitely a movie you should watch.

The &#x22;little town&#x22; and &#x22;quiet village&#x22; have jumped to worldwide fame.
With a fantastic cast and a well-loved original, expectations raised to
breaking point. My favorite parts of this remade fantasy, which
successfully combined the old plot with new elements, were the
excellent singing and the believable romantic relationship.I hardly ever cry at movies, but I did during Beauty and the Beast. The
songs -&#x22;Belle,&#x22; &#x22;Beauty and the Beast,&#x22; and &#x22;Something There,&#x22; to name
a few - powerfully resonate with the beautiful voices of the
well-chosen cast members. The song &#x22;If I Can&#x27;t Love Her&#x22; was especially
moving as the Beast frees Belle and watches her run away.I was really glad that the bond between Beauty and the Beast seemed to
form a real relationship. In the old movie, it almost seems that they
avoid one another and they do not talk much. In the remake, they seem
to really get along together and boost each other up: the beast takes
Belle to her old home and grants her freedom, and Belle reads to the
Beast and nurtures him back to health.Sometimes the conversations in the movie seem a little stilted and
awkward. However, the overall connection between Beauty and the Beast
overcomes these brief moments, and it is believable that both would
risk death for the other. With high-quality music, casting, animation,
character roles, and acting, this movie concocted a brilliant
performance at which anyone would love to &#x22;be a guest.&#x22;
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Expected a rehash and once again Disney surpasses expectations<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Say what you will about Disney but whomever is at the helm nowadays is
brilliant. So far their live action renditions have brought in
Billions. Beauty and The Beast might be the first of the truly modern
day Animated classics they&#x27;ve &#x22;rebooted&#x22; in a live action way. I
thought it looked cool and was excited to see it but cautiously so
because wouldn&#x27;t it just be the same thing seen before in Animation? In
short...yes. In long, it didn&#x27;t matter! The direction, cinematography
and seeing the classic fairy tale in live action makes it all the more
impressive. It is perfectly cast and wonderfully performed. I found
myself excited for the familiarity of some of the musical numbers and
really enjoyed the story all over again. I saw a review or two that
called the film trash for being liberal and I still can&#x27;t wrap my head
around that. I wish this over-PC world would calm itself and just enjoy
something for a change. Disney is brilliant because they found a way to
remake their classic films for a new generation but they also don&#x27;t
skimp on sheer quality. These films Beauty and The Beast included are
magnificent with huge budgets so it is understandable why they&#x27;re doing
it and I will keep seeing them for sure!It seemed something of a controversy to cast Emma Watson but I think
she does a very good job. I think she is finally breaking the mould
that was the Harry Potter franchise. She is really perfect as Belle.
It&#x27;s not exactly a meaty part and she&#x27;s beautiful and headstrong and
makes for a good heroine. Dan Stevens is excellent as The Beast. He is
as good as his animated counterpart from years ago. He perfectly
captures the personality and torment and still shows some fierce
loyalty to Belle. Their chemistry together is perfect for the film.
It&#x27;s not too intense but not understated either. In a film like this
where the characters are iconic and so Disney-esque, the supporting
cast is as important as ever. Luke Evans and Josh Gad are absolutely
perfectly cast as the villainous Gaston and his henchman LeFou. Kevin
Kline, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson (still would have
loved to have seen Angela Landsbury return), Nathan Mack, Audra
McDonald and Stanley Tucci all add something truly special to the film
in their own way. Some of the more iconic characters (Lumiere and
Cogsworth) are more understated I thought this time around but maybe
that is okay for a live action film. Gaston is also more evil than he
was in the animated version. Things are just turned up more in this
version. It&#x27;s a little darker, a little more vivid and large and a
little more magic.Bill Condon was a very interesting choice for the director of Beauty
and The Beast. He has a lot of experience but I wouldn&#x27;t have expected
him to be able to pull this off. He plays things very safely. He makes
sure all the things that fans of Beauty and The Beast would expect BUT
he also gives it just a little bit more to keep new fans and old fans
locked into a whole new remake. It&#x27;s a beautiful film and stands beside
it&#x27;s animated counterpart. Time will tell if it will be a classic as
well. 8/10
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just as Magical, But 3 Major Criticisms<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I loved the cast. I LOVE Luke EVANS! He he has a wonderful singing
voice and was a fantastic actor. He was the perfect Gaston. Just as Gad
was the perfect LeFou. He had the goofy sidekick part down, but also
held his own when he sings &#x22;Gaston&#x22;. McGregor was the perfect Lumiere,
I thought Stevens was a wonderful Beast and actually found this voice
and appearance more majestic than the animated one that just looked
more monstrous.I only have three complaints: 1. Belle does not read while she walks as much. She&#x27;s supposed to have
her nose in a book for the entire &#x22;Belle&#x22; song, and yet, she does not
even have her nose in the book when they say the line &#x22;nose stuck in a
book&#x22;.The reason this upset me so much is that this specific scene of Belle
walking through town reading and being oblivious to everything around
her was what made her my favorite character and made this one of my
favorite stories. In the original Belle is reading as she maneuvers
through the market and rather than stop reading she just raises her
hand to hold up the inn sign so it blocks the water from hitting her. I
felt like I was Belle, because I walked while reading ALL THE TIME.
Seeing Belle do this made me feel less weird and I loved it. Therefore,
having the newest version of Belle simply walk with the book at her
side was very disappointing to me.2. Gaston does not throw Belle&#x27;s book in the mud. Instead he walks over
her cabbages.It&#x27;s a critical change, in my mind. Belle is portrayed as weird because
she reads, her head is always in the clouds and she&#x27;s too intelligent
for a woman. Gaston, the village hero represents their way of thinking,
actually comments on this by saying &#x22;It&#x27;s not right for a woman to
read, she starts getting ideas and thinking&#x22;. Then he throws her book
in the mud. It is symbolic of the fact that the whole village disagrees
with her love of books, and further proves why Gaston is not for her,
especially with the juxtaposition of the Beast showing her his library.
Books are a critical part of this story. Books are the reason the
villagers think Belle odd. Books are the reason the Beast and Belle get
along so well. Books are the reason Gaston is clearly wrong for her.So I&#x27;m sorry, as a girl who decided the castle in Beauty and the Beast
was better than all the others because of the library, a girl who hated
Gaston and actually cried when he threw a book in the mud, a girl who
related to Belle because she too walked and read simultaneously&#x85;of
course I am going to be critical of the book scenes.3. Gaston leaves Maurice to die by wolves in the forest.Gaston is the villain of the story, no question. However, I always
interpreted him as an arrogant bully who was meant to be the foil
character. He&#x27;s more into physical strength than intelligence, and he&#x27;s
more into material things than emotional understanding. He prides
himself on hunting trophies and wants Belle because she&#x27;s the most
beautiful girl in the village. Then at the end of the film he tries to
kill the Beast, but we&#x27;re to know that&#x27;s because he is the symbolic
character that represents all of the village and people who judge based
on appearances alone. He wants Belle for her looks, and he tries to
kill the Beast because of his looks. This film and this message fit
perfectly with the idea of &#x22;Don&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover&#x22;. In this
version he wants Belle so badly that he&#x27;s willing to leave her father
in the forest to die when he gets in his way. This takes Gaston&#x27;s
villainy to a whole new levelAside from those three criticisms I loved this film. I loved how one of
my favorite stories was brought to life. I cannot believe I was 1 when
the first film came out and saw this one for my 27th birthday. watching
this live-action version is how I celebrated my 27th birthday. But as they say, it&#x27;s a tale as old as time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Definitely lives up to the classic!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Coming from someone who grew up on Disney movies and who&#x27;s favorite
classic Disney movie has and always will be Beauty and the Beast,this
movie absolutely lived up to my expectations and more.Emma Watson did such an amazing job as Belle. The rest of the cast were
just as perfect for their roles from Luke Evans as Gaston, to Emma
Thompson as Mrs. Pots, etc.Although there were minor differences in the story line, it didn&#x27;t take
away from the important parts of the movie. I didn&#x27;t even mind the new
addition of songs that were not part of the classic as it helped tie
everything together so well.I also enjoyed that they dove a little deeper into both Belle and
Beast&#x27;s background story and showed much more of how their friendship
grew and eventually transitioned into romance.All in all, I believed it achieved its goal in staying true to the
classic while also giving us a new perspective from a live action
version. I can&#x27;t wait to watch it again! Job well done!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A gorgeous adaptation of the animated film<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney&#x27;s latest live-action adaptation is the musical romance, Beauty
in the Beast. Using stunning and gorgeous special effects, the story of
Belle (Emma Watson) and her imprisonment by and growing affection for
the Beat (Dan Stevens) plays out in the same way as the cartoon. A
selfish prince is cursed by an enchantress and everyone in his castle
is turned into fancy objects. Belle finds herself in a small town
gossiped about by the villagers and wooed by the crude hunter Gaston
(Luke Evans). Belle&#x27;s father Maurice (Kevin Kline) is an inventor
hoping to sell his wares at the market when he becomes lost in the
woods and stumbles upon the enchanted castle. He is imprisoned by the
Beast but his horse returns to Belle who seeks out her father. Belle trades places with her father but is let out of her cell by the
mouthy candlestick Lumiere (Ewan McGregor). The cautious clock
Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) does not support the idea but Mrs. Potts (Emma
Thompson), her son Chip (Nathan Mack), the dresser Madame Garderobe
(Audra McDonald), and Maestro Cadenza (Stanley Tucci) are friendly to
Belle and encourage the Beast to talk with her. They romance starts
slow but in time their affection grows. Meanwhile, supported by his
friend LeFou (Josh Gad), Gaston continues his plan to wed Belle by
trying to win over her father who spouts outrageous stories of the
Beast capturing Belle. Gaston does not believe him and they are unable
to discover the castle.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Directorial Letdown for film with many strong elements<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
A solid B. Which is slightly disappointing considering the original
film is an A+ classic nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. Much of
the script was reworked and rewritten for this new version, many of
what I feel are the most powerful and memorable bits of dialogue were
reworded and lost their power in the process. On the other hand, this
film added a lot of background action and backstory to nearly all the
characters (even adding a few new characters) which brought a lot of
life to the production, certainly helping to flesh out the Beast and
his servants in particular, though even Gaston, Maurice, and Belle got
more to work with. To my surprise, none of the performances stuck out as bad. Though
Watson looked a little tentative during the earlier musical numbers,
she delivered a fine performance through to the end of the film (though
I found myself hoping she&#x27;d be more feisty like her animated
counterpart). Dan Stevens as the Beast was a revelation, adding humor
and depth to the character. While I thought when listening to the
soundtrack that most of the new songs were dreadful, the new
showstopper &#x22;Evermore&#x22; was beautifully executed by Stevens and became
one of the most effective moments of the movie. Luke Evans made a
marvelous Gaston, Josh Gad created a shockingly multilayered LeFou, and
Ewan McGregor was pitch perfect as Lumiere. The funniest moments of the
film easily went to Gad, Stevens and Ian McKellen, who played
Cogsworth. My biggest complaint is the noticeable absence of the joyous, brilliant
&#x22;Human Again&#x22; number written for the original film, cut, added to the
subsequent Broadway production, then re-edited back into the film.
Instead, it was replaced by a rather sad sounding song called &#x22;Days in
the Sun&#x22; with effectively the same theme.Overall, my problem was neither with the actors or the design (which
was stellar; I could have gazed at the detail on the set for days), but
with the writing and directing. Whose idea was it to make Audra
McDonald do an Italian accent, making all the wardrobe&#x27;s lines clunky
and unfunny? Most of the new songs don&#x27;t hold a candle to songs written
for the original film or the Broadway production. Belle and Maurice&#x27;s
new backstory felt oddly placed and a tad contrived. Given all this new
material, it would have been fun to see director Bill Condon take some
risks, but they never came. Even the way certain scenes were shot
seemed uninspired. I enjoyed a great deal of the new material, I loved
the life it breathed into the supporting characters, but they should
have either gone all the way with it or not done it at all. Most
distracting is that the Beast was done digitally rather than with
makeup - it took you right out of the famous supposed-to-be-stunning
dance scene. Stevens was on set acting with dots on his face, offering
eyelines, and delivering a great performance. It&#x27;s a shame they felt
they couldn&#x27;t do it practically.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>One major part in the original was not exaggerated enough!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This film was overall amazing! I give it an A-. My family &#x26; I have been
obsessed with Beauty &#x26; the Beast for as long as I could remember! I was
hoping for the film to be EXACTLY like the original, but we can&#x27;t
always get what we want. That being said, most of the changes in the
film didn&#x27;t take anything away from the original, however, the one part
I was truly hoping they would keep the same was &#x22;underdramatized&#x22; &#x26; a
little disappointing. As Belle flees the castle in the original, beast
roars a beautifully agonizing roar to show his pain. In this film, he
breaks into his own sad song. As his song was coming to a close, my
family and I were at the edge of our seats desperately waiting to hear
that roar, but to our dismay guys, it didn&#x27;t happen! WHY???!!! WHY???!!
We needed to feel his emotion Disney!! That was one of the greatest
emotional parts aside from &#x22;Tale as Old as Time&#x22;, &#x26; beast&#x27;s
transformation. :( Not to worry though, the finale (Gaston storming the
castle, Beast dying &#x26; his castle staff dying - yes everyone dies and it
is the saddest part EVER!) will completely bring you to tears &#x26; blow
you away! Totally made up for it. Will be going back to see it again
for a second time!

I never expected much from a live action remake of a cartoon classic,
so I had low expectations. I did not care about the hype either. The
only interesting thing about the movie is the use of 3D. Apart from
that, the story is not new, it is just a conversion of the animated
version to live action. The musical numbers were inferior to the
original. The only good part of the movie is Luke Evan&#x27;s role as
Gaston. The minute I learned he was cast as Gatson, I knew he would be
wonderful. In fact, his character was the most interesting in the
movie. Emma Watson was okay, but fails to exude her &#x27;Hermione&#x27; in
Belle. The cast of talented actors did not help elevate the story much.
Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson are wasted. The CGI was terrible too.
The Beast effects was very unrealistic and distracting. All in all, the
only reason to enjoy this movie is because of the 3D, Luke Evans, and
nostalgia. It would be a good movie for kids who have not seen the
original animation.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Nostalgia factor is key.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I thought the movie was fine. However, there were so many things that
this new adaptation missed.And among the things missed, was the feisty, sassy, charismatic Belle
that I&#x27;d known and loved. There was a warm girl with a big heart, and
she was fully present in the original movie. In this remake, starring
Emma Watson, Belle was much colder. Belle didn&#x27;t capture your heart.
There was a detached feeling. Emma Watson is a perfectly good actress,
but she wasn&#x27;t Belle, she was not Belle at all.The CGI on the Beast was horrible, but I learned to grow used to it as
the movie progressed. I really didn&#x27;t become fully immersed into the
movie until it was almost over. By far, my favorite actors in the movie would have to be the two
playing Gaston and Lefou. They breathed new life into their characters,
they made things interesting. I very much enjoyed them whenever they
were on screen, but that must have been the only positive contribution
made here.What&#x27;s that saying? &#x22;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&#x22;? The only benefit
I found in this was the waves of nostalgia I received from hearing all
of the classic musical numbers and seeing the iconic yellow dress as
Belle and the Beast waltzed across their ballroom. I still love, love,
LOVE, this story. I love Beauty and the Beast and the strange sadness
and longing for old Disney films that it inspires within me. I couldn&#x27;t
help comparing the 2017 version to the 1991 version, and feeling
slightly disappointed (at times), throughout the movie.This film was just a cash grabber. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve got many live action
movies coming up in the next couple years. We&#x27;ll probably be seeing a
real-life Mulan, Aladdin, etc., etc., in the next few years. I
re-watched the original movie at home, and really felt that there was
so much more that could&#x27;ve been done for the remake. The Beast just
wasn&#x27;t as temperamental, or lovable, as the original. Belle wasn&#x27;t the
kindest or most accepting, either. I didn&#x27;t hate Gaston as much in this
adaptation either, when --frankly-- I should have, even if just a
little.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney did it again!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was very apprehensive about a couple of things prior to seeing Beauty
&#x26; the Beast, the first was Emma Watson playing Belle and the other was
Lafou also how the songs would flow but within 1-2 minutes of the film
I was at ease and even brought tears to my eyes they captured it almost
perfectly. Emma Watson Didn&#x27;t disappoint me nor did the Lafou character
I even enjoyed both. The show stealers though for me were Gaston &#x26; The
Beast portrayed by Luke Evans &#x26; Dan Stevens. I even thought 2hrs 10
minutes ish was a long running time but it flowed along brilliantly and
I was amazed at how beautifully the film was filmed from scene to
scene. Better than the classic original? no! but almost a like for like
remake into a live action animated film.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It was good for the audience this  movie is meant to be...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast is, was and always will be my favorite off all
Disney movies (concidering the princess theme). This movie was good,
not perfect but good. I read many posts about how bad this movie was
but lets not forget that a movie is not only its actors but all in
union. Acting 7.5 ,Music 9.5 ,Singing 7, Directing 7, Costumes 10+,
Sets 10+ My final verdict is 7. I liked it but yet just in moments I felt that I was going to be
thrilled like the original one I did not, but this movie was not the
original one. It was a remake,a remake to dazzle the new generations
not us, it was created to have as a main audience children not 25+
people and it was good enough to do that.Also do not forget that in
this one Disney decided to give a proper representation of the time
line that these event happened and to say the truth that was not one of
the most beautiful eras considering clothing,hair etc. also the put
information about to many questions had been left unanswered all these
years(something new of the most of us and unfamiliar). Emma&#x27;s singing and the era that the story took
place were the thinks that thought me off. In general the movie is
perfect remake of the original considering the story and the musical
essence of the music. It was good movie better than any other I have seen the last hole
year.I would like to see this over and over again than seeing Batman Vs
Superman or Suicide Squade again..... Enjoy!!P.S. And remember some thinks will never be as good as the originals or
like the first time....:D
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Whimsical Yet Captivating Take on the Disney Classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon is a whimsical yet
captivating film that I highly adored watching. This live action film
has made my &#x22;Top 10 List&#x22; due to its incredible singing performances,
marvelous set designs and accuracy of the original Disney story. As a
Disney fanatic myself, I absolutely love that this film has the power
to take me back to my younger days. Daughter of a wise and humble merchant (Kevin Kline), Belle (Emma
Watson) is a bright and independent young lady who will be taken as a
prisoner by a monstrous beast (Dan Stevens) in place of her elderly,
caring father. As prisoner of the Beast in his cold dark castle, Belle
soon builds a strong bond with the talking enchanted objects of the
castle. Who will help break the lasting &#x22;forever curse&#x22; by bringing the
Beast and Belle closer? Belle learns to look past the frightening
physical appearance of the Beast and looks upon his caring gentle soul.
But, will this be enough to break the lasting forever curse upon the
castle and the Beast?Incorporated as a live action film from Disney&#x27;s original animated
film, Beauty and the Beast, the whole cast delivers exquisite
performances portraying each unique and iconic character. The caring,
yet brave Belle is played by the talented actress Emma Watson. Watson
has appeared in numerous films including the Harry Potter films, My
Week with Marilyn and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Dan Stevens,
known from Legion TV Series deftly portrays the terrifying Beast, a
difficult character to play due to its temper. From the songs, to the set designs, this film has it all. I truly
appreciate and love that they took the 1991 Disney classic and turned
it into a live action film. This is something that has not been seen
before and was well directed by Bill Condon (Mr. Holmes, The Twilight
Saga: Breaking Dawn &#x96; Part 1 and 2, Dreamgirls). Being a huge Disney
princess fan, I am highly pleased with the accuracy of this live action
version. The costumes, songs, characters and plot are all very
accurate. It made me feel as if I was in a Disney story book. One of favorite things about this film and the story of Beauty and the
Beast itself, is the message it depicts &#x96; that of looking past the
physical and looking within. This is a moral that every viewer can
learn from. The film is very successful in massaging this message and
the audience will easily relate to the moral as the film unfolds before
their eyes.This enchanted, unbelievable film deserves 5 out of 5. I highly
recommend it to families, young children and Disney fanatics. Kids and
adults both will enjoy watching it and singing along with the iconic
songs. Reviewed by Maria G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful! BUT...Consistently Tries to Validate Itself...Ultimately an Unnecessary Remake<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Prepare yourself for &#x22;a tale as old as time&#x22; that is ultimately better
told through its animated counterpart. Director Bill Condon&#x27;s
live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the first animated film
nominated for Best Picture at the (1992) Academy Awards, is an
extravagant display of visual effects and digital imagery necessary to
animate a live-action motion picture. Essentially, he took an animated
movie, made it live-action, just to make it animated again. Sure, this
new version of the &#x22;song as old as rhyme&#x22; can certainly stand on its
own and is demonstrably well-directed, but 2017&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast
largely comes across as unnecessary. In terms of the storytelling (or
diegesis), the film&#x27;s effort to nearly shot-for-shot translate the most
memorable parts of the film from animation to live-action pays off
nicely! It&#x27;s when the film tries to be different that it falls short in
its delivery. You may find yourself exhausted and over-stimulated by
the constant waves of computer-animated figures in a live-action world.
Oh yeah, you&#x27;ll likely miss hearing the legendary Angela Lansbury as
the iconic Mrs. Potts.Can this film stand on its own? Sure. There is no question in that.
Moreover, is it enjoyable and magical? That, it is. But when most of
the campaign, leading up to the highly anticipated release, was
primarily built upon how similar the live-action film would be to its
animated counterpart, therein a problem arises. Because most people
going into the movie will have seen the animated version, Broadway
show, or even the show at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (which, in full
disclosure, is a show that I worked when I was a Cast Member at Walt
Disney World), you are predisposed to looking for and eagerly awaiting
the nostalgic references and memories. And there is nothing wrong with
that. In fact, I was looking forward to reliving the experience of when
I first saw the animated movie. For the most part, if you are like me,
then you will be pleased with the live-action translation&#x96;truly.
However, it&#x27;s when the live-action version departs from or adds in
material not found or referenced in the animated classic that you may
be disappointed or simply ask &#x22;why?&#x22; You may find yourself wondering
why was a live-action remake even necessary?One of the most memorable elements of Disney&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast
(1991) is the music! Still to this day, millions of people love hearing
the classic music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Both the
Beauty and the Beast and Be Our Guest can be heard as part of other
shows at Walt Disney World and of course are included in the stage show
at Hollywood Studios. Fortunately, the most iconic songs from the
animated version are largely untouched; however, with a couple of the
songs, there are breaks for diegetic dancing, fighting, or other
material that essentially interrupts the organic flow of the music from
the buildup to the climax and denouement. Furthermore, here&#x27;s something
quite interesting and odd: the song &#x22;Human Again&#x22; was written for but
deleted when it originally hit theatres in 1991. It was, however, added
back in for the Broadway show and in the 2010 (and Diamond Edition)
re-release of the movie. Although it was seen as important enough to
include in the Broadway show and add back into the animated version, it
is conspicuously missing from the live-action remake.Okay, now for the white elephant in the room: Josh Gad&#x27;s Lefou. Unless
you have been completely disconnected from social media and the news,
you&#x27;ve undoubtedly heard or read about the first ever Disney &#x22;gay
moment&#x22; in this film. Suffice it to say, the whole thing has been blown
way out of proportion. In fact, more attention is likely being paid to
Lefou now than had the story never grown to the size of Gaston&#x27;s ego.
For the most part, the subtext and subtitles of Lefou&#x27;s are largely
just that&#x96;subtle&#x96;unless you are looking for them. But, in doing that,
you may miss some of the more important and impressive parts of the
movie. Moreover, there is nothing in Lefou&#x27;s actions that come across
as offensive or obnoxious. Before audiences begin accusing Disney of
pushing their ideals on those eager to attend this film, it is likely
that the entertainment and media giant is simply delivering what
audiences already expect or want. As a film and media professor, I can
tell you that by in large, media simply delivers what audiences and
investors are telling them to produce&#x96;not the other way around. Looking
back at the animated film, it is pretty obvious that Lefou has a thing
for Gaston anyway. Although most of the hints at his sexual orientation
are more-or-less winks or nods at the audience (winks or nods that you
have to be looking for), there is a moment that is a trifle more
obvious at the end of the film. Diegetically, there is nothing bizarre
about Lefou&#x27;s behavior and it suits his character well.Prepare to be whisked away to an enchanted castle in a remote part of
France. So remote is this province in France, that most everyone speaks
with a British accent. Bill Condon&#x27;s film will take you back to when
you first saw this magical tale of falling in love with someone based
upon what&#x27;s on the inside and not allowing a beastly outward appearance
to detract from the gentle soul. Relive the music that you may still
listen to in the car or eagerly look forward to when visiting the
Disney Parks and Resorts. Ultimately, this film may not capture the
magic of the original for you, but there is a lot to enjoy! Looking for
a great date movie this weekend, then this is definitely it! Hopefully
a side effect of this film may remind producers and audiences that some
stories are better suited for an animated motion picture.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Very nice remake of 1991 animated classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The biggest impression from seeing this remake was &#x22;Wow, it&#x27;s just like
the 1991 animated movie!&#x22; The biggest changes are that both Beauty and
the Beast are given back stories about their parents, you glean more
about the enchantress that cast the spell, and there are a few
character changes that are very slight, including a Wardrobe with a
more amazing singing voice than Jo Ann Worley who has an unlikely
hookup with the Cadenza played by-over-the top Stanley Tucci. Most of
the music is the same, with different voices of course. It&#x27;s all very
nice, but leaves you yearning for the original singers nonetheless,
especially Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts and Jerry Obach as Lumiere.
Emma Thompson makes a fine Mrs Potts, but it is hard to replace Angela
Lansbury.Kevin Kline inevitably made the part of Maurice, Belle&#x27;s father, more
engaging and memorable. Kudos to Luke Evans Gaston and Josh Gad&#x27;s
LeFou. They really let loose to actually become their animated
over-the-top counterparts. The twist on LeFou&#x27;s character at the end
made perfect sense!There are a couple songs I don&#x27;t remember from the original, perhaps
because they are less memorable altogether? At the end is a powerful
rendition of &#x22;Evermore&#x22; where I was thinking that the Beast, played by
Dan Stevens, has a much better singing voice than I thought. Then the
credits rolled by and I saw that song was by Josh Grogan. Very, very
nice! Go see this movie. Then you will also want to watch the 1991 version
again I bet.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A great movie but wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast was my favorite childhood movie so I was super
excited to see the live action adaptation starring Emma Watson. It
didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations but I think it&#x27;s only because I love
the original so much. There were a lot of added details that I enjoyed
but I found myself shaking my head during some scenes. I liked how it
was modernized and the costumes were pretty good. The CGI of the castle
servants were a little weird to me but I didn&#x27;t think the beast&#x27;s
animations were that bad. The transformation scene honestly let me
down. The scene in he original is amazing so I expected the live action
to be as amazing, if not better. I know there&#x27;s only so much you can do
in a live action movie but I was still expecting more. Still overall a
great movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Really good family movie!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Went to see this movie at Disney Springs on opening night. Was
pleasantly surprised how good it was. I like that they stayed close to
the cartoon and reused some of the songs. Our whole family liked it. I&#x27;m puzzled by reviewers that rated this movie below a 7. Everyone&#x27;s
entitled to their opinion but I don&#x27;t see how this movie is below a 7.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>This live action retelling exceeded my expectations &#x26; gave a classic new life!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As a fan of most Disney films &#x26; someone who grew up with the original
Beauty &#x26; The Beast, I was already going in knowing that I would most
likely enjoy the movie. The film did have a lot to live up too as in my
opinion it&#x27;s really the first live action remake of a Disney movie that
already has a massive fan base, Cinderella &#x26; The Jungle Book had a bit
more room to breathe. I wasn&#x27;t sure about Emma Watson, the CGI or the
idea of any tampering with a classic but all of that was quickly
demolished as I watched the film in its glory! I really can&#x27;t think of
anything substantial that went wrong with this. It was carefully
crafted to lay down an almost word for word, scene by scene remake
while also breaking new ground &#x26; beefing up the story to make it fresh!
I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like any new developments, songs, plot twists,
etc.. but everything really worked &#x26; it worked well! Emma Watson &#x26; the
entire cast nails their interpretations &#x26; the music is on point &#x26; amped
up to give it a more dramatic flare! The imagery in the film is often
breathtaking &#x26; the CGI work is crafted wonderfully! I am sure there are going to be many people that will pick this film
apart to within an inch of sanity, let them!! It&#x27;s their miserable
loss. This is a perfect movie for fans who grew up with the original &#x26;
new audiences alike! It&#x27;s really one of the most enjoyable times at the
movie theater I&#x27;ve had in quite awhile! GO SEE IT while it&#x27;s on the big screen!! You really won&#x27;t regret it! I
was very impressed &#x26; so we&#x27;re the group of friends I seen it with!Also, for those who enjoy 3-D, I did see it in 3-D format &#x26; that is
also another A+! The 3-D is beautiful &#x26; feels natural, not just a film
turned into 3-D for 3-D&#x27;s sake! The 3-D experience here really did take
you into the world of Beauty &#x26; The Beast!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Love It!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have watched the original animated Beauty And The Beast many many
times butt still, the movie is super entertaining and just exciting.
Butt there is a couple of cons, one of which is every 5 minutes there&#x27;s
gonna be a song. Overall the movie is brilliand, 9/10 would watch
again.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Magical, but had a lot to live up to.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; was a fantastic movie altogether although it had
a lot to live up to. The original version of the film captured the
hearts of millions and is arguably hard to top. This movie would need
to meet or exceed the magic of the original and I felt it only met it.The music is amazing - of course! - especially with the new songs
written for the film. The actors do their best to portray their beloved
counterparts while bringing a fresh revival to each. Most importantly,
this movie just gives you more. The story is new and the visuals are
exquisite. This movie does lack, however. Disney could have done more
for the story to make it unique. The story in itself felt rushed at
times - like we don&#x27;t already know the essentials! - and so it made it
feel just a bit less magical.Even though I feel Disney went above and beyond to help answer
questions and give us more to the story that was lacking from the
original, we leave with different questions that I wish could have been
explained. Now, as for the live-action portrayal in general, Cinderella
was better - granted, it set the standard for these remakes - because
there was no standard other than having Disney not mess up a classic.
Here, everything was on the line, and Disney did admirably, but overall
just couldn&#x27;t quite make a perfect 10/10 movie for this Disney
enthusiast.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Tale as old as time gets a worthy remake.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney are full steam ahead with live action remakes of their beloved
animated classics, with Pete&#x27;s Dragon and The Jungle Book getting the
treatment last year. This year however sees Disney take the biggest
risk yet with a live action remake of Beauty and the Beast, which is
widely thought of as one of the studio&#x27;s best ever animated films and
loved by so many of all ages around the world.Beauty and the Beast tells the tale of Belle (Emma Watson), a girl seen
as strange by the rest of her fellow villagers but sought after by the
arrogant Gaston (Luke Evans). When Belle learns of her father, Maurice
(Kevin Kline), being held captive in a hidden castle, she takes his
place, becoming the prisoner of Beast (Dan Stevens), a once handsome
prince cursed by an enchantress for not seeing that true beauty lies
within, before they fall in love with one another.As soon as Beauty and the Beast finished, I breathed a huge sigh of
relief. Not because it had finished and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of
there but because Disney had avoided tarnishing their animated classic
and had actually made a very good film, much better than I was
expecting anyway.Lavish in both its production and costume design, Beauty and the Beast
very much looks the part of a live action Disney adaptation with
gorgeous practical sets and colourful frocks aplenty. The visual
effects, as expected these days, really are very good as well, bringing
the film and its animated characters to life with great verve,
particularly Lumiere, Cogsworth and Beast.The film has faced many people before release claiming it to be a
pointless remake however, when they do as good a job as they do with
this film then I fail to see where they are coming from. Bill Condon
has made a film that clearly respects the animated version while adding
new elements that don&#x27;t do the film any harm at all. This is a very fun
film as well, thanks to some high energy musical numbers, Gaston and Be
Our Guest being my personal favourites, while I&#x27;m very glad to say the
John Legend and Ariana Grande version of Beauty and the Beast does not
accompany one of the film&#x27;s most important moments, instead being
rightfully sung by Mrs. Potts.Coming to the performances, Beauty and the Beast features a cast that
all deliver commendable performances in both acting and singing
departments. Emma Watson makes for a very good Belle, even if her over
pronunciation of words does continue to irritate me and her singing
really did take me by surprise. I was a bit skeptical to start with but
as the film progressed, I felt more comfortable listening to her sing.
Dan Stevens and Luke Evans can sing pretty damn well too, Evans doing
it with suitable amounts of arrogance as Gaston. The real star of the
show though is Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, who steals the show with a
brilliant vocal performance that includes a brilliant rendition of Be
Our Guest.So Beauty and the Beast is a very good time at the cinema that takes
its place just behind The Jungle Book when it comes to the best live
action Disney remakes. Oh, and the gay moment that was made into a big
deal prior to its release, is nothing but a mountain out of a molehill.
Bring on The Lion King and Mulan.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A very good movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I am a fan of 1991 version but have to agree that this live action
Beauty and the Beast is amazing. The CGI and visual effects are so
good. Emma brought out a dreamy yet intelligent, fearless Belle. Dan
Stevens did a very decent job with the Beast. They made the Beast with
CGI but leave his eyes. So we have the Beast with human - and - so -
emotional eyes which we hardly have in 1991 version.I totally in love with this movie. One thing I wish more is that maybe
they should have given more room for the real actors when their
characters came to life after breaking the spell.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>That Was Magical<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Out of all the Disney live action remakes in the works, perhaps none
more sacred to film fans than Beauty and the Beast. Dissecting and
critiquing every set photo, clip, and trailer to pieces, there was a
ton of pressure on Bill Condon&#x27;s remake. With that said, it&#x27;s hard to
imagine a more fitting re-imagining of the classic tale than the one we
were given.Let&#x27;s talk about this cast. This may be the most perfectly cast film
I&#x27;ve seen in quite some time. Starting with Emma Watson as the beloved
princess, Belle. Lily James certainly had some pressure taking on
Cinderella, but to today&#x27;s audience, Belle is the more popular
character. Watson wasn&#x27;t going to please everyone, but she captures
Belle&#x27;s wonder, intelligence, curiosity, passion, and of course,
beauty. Pair her with a great performance by Dan Stevens as the
co-lead, and you have your classic romance.Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Kevin Kline as Maurice, Ewan
McGregor as Lumi&#xE8;re, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, and Emma Thompson as
Mrs. Potts? Come on now, casting that impeccably just isn&#x27;t normal.
They don&#x27;t just look like their animated counterparts from the 1991
version, they completely embody every aspect of what made us love them
in the first place. McGregor and McKellan have a hilarious back and
forth, as do Gad and Evans, and Kline &#x26; Thompson will break your heart
as respected parents.As for the music, which probably provided the most hesitation from avid
fans. Would they change things too much? Too little? Would the new
songs actually add anything of value? I wasn&#x27;t bothered by any of the
new music, but none of them particularly stood out either. But they
nailed all of the new renditions of the classic Alan Menken hits. I
don&#x27;t know that anyone can top Angela Lansbury&#x27;s Beauty and the
Beast/Tale as Old as Time, but Emma Thompson gives it her best effort.
The &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; scene? Yep, it&#x27;s just as ridiculously fun as the
original.The additional time spent fleshing out the Beast and Belle&#x27;s individual
backstories felt necessary and not excessive. Really, the only thing
that needed working on in this movie was Beast&#x27;s CGI. There were
moments of really noticeable effects work, especially in the ballroom
dance sequence. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s one of the most important scenes
in the film, you&#x27;d think that would be something they spent a little
more time on. In the same vein, not all of the green screen was
polished either. I love how colorful and wondrous the production design
and sets are, but that can only do so much. But if the CGI is all I&#x27;m
complaining about, then I think the filmmakers did alright.I watched the 1991 version a lot as a kid, so this was a remake that
was near and dear to my heart and pretty much my entire generation.
With the exception of a few CGI filled scenes, I think this ranks up
there with the best of Disney Live Action remakes. It&#x27;s not often I get
swept up with emotion at the climax of a kids movie, but I just
couldn&#x27;t help myself with this one. The cinematography, the
performances, and that legendary music all came together at the end.
This was nothing short of a magical time at the theaters.+Perfect cast+Glorious music+Felt the Disney magic once again+Subtle additions were beneficial-Beast CGI was worse than I originally thought9.3/10

Beauty and the Beast was a wonderful movie to watch with my kids and
husband! The visual effects were stunning, and the original songs a
delight to my ears! I admire the scriptwriters&#x27; creativity in cleaning
up the plot holes and adding dimension to Le Fou. Emma Watson&#x27;s singing
was a pleasure to hear, and Dan Steven&#x27;s &#x22;Evermore&#x22; was powerful and
soaring. If you enjoyed watching Cinderella or La La Land, this is the
movie for you! Bravo, Alan Condon!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney, the professional<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Well, let&#x27;s be honest. The beauty and the beast, a tale as old as time,
even as most of us know it since 1991, is a story that maybe never
needed a remake, never needed any improvement from the iconic original
Disney movie and especially will split viewers in haters and lovers.
Here is why.Emma Watson, a heroine for the whole Harry Potter generation with
acting skills one could discuss but a charm and beauty you cannot
ignore, embodies the new Belle in a way the story fits to our society.
Luke Evans sticks out with perfect role fit, awesome skills and IS and
will always be the real life Gaston. Dan Stevens as a CGI overloaded
beast, Josh Gad as funny, gay and sympathetic companion on the bad
side, and many stars more to fill the flick with life, music and fun.
They all are a cast which let you agree, yes, if it was real, that&#x27;s
how the people were!But, and there is the split, what never is emphasized that much in a
comic movie, is how fake and kitschy most of the backgrounds, costumes,
dialogues and if you want the musical scenes are looking. Critiques are
already summarizing missing singing skills of some cast members, the
bad CGI and the fake atmosphere and I agree, still I absolutely loved
this movie. You cannot expect a copy of the comic movie with talking
closets, candlesticks or watches, a horse that finds the way and
obviously stupid villagers doing illogical stuff all the day without
looking fake. What was easier in Jungle Book, were the only week spot
was the human, is not comparable with the more musical oriented script
of Beauty and the Beast. Yes maybe the wolves and the beast could have
been better, but if you are ready to jump into the musical
entertainment show with all your kids heart from the 90ies, you are
going to feel with all characters and situations the way Disney want
you to and smile at the screen with every melody you could sing along
immediately. If you were never one of these guys, then Disney could
have done whatever you want and you would not have been satisfied. To summarize, chapeau for Luke Evans, thank you dear filmmakers for
showing character and sticking to small gay gags and erasing a lot of
illogical things out of the comic movie to make it &#x22;more&#x22; realistic and
consistent, congratulations for Emma Watson enchanting the next
generation of kids with a beloved story and melodies and I pay all my
respects to the so often criticized Disney company for just knowing
what they do for fans. Besides company policy or whatever I am not the
one to judge, in filmmaking they are professionals, period.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>fan&#x27;s dream come true<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Ever since i saw the first teaser,i was dying to see this childhood
favourite animation movie come alive as a liveaction Hollywood
adaptation.As any other DisneyFairytale fan,my expectations were way
too high with this one.Although i was not very pleased with their
casting (EmmaWatson and Luke evans specially),i had no shortage of
desperation to finally witness the epic eternal love story produced in
today&#x27;s advanced filmmaking facilities. And i am happy to say that i
didn&#x27;t get disappointed this time.This movie has met all my
expectations and exceeded in some aspects.3D effects are extremely
aesthetic and quiet a feast to eyes.the CG work of particles,fur,cloth
etc is of sheer brilliance (as i would expect with Disney,it was
perfectly balanced and neither photorealistic nor cartoonish..) There
is nothing to say about the story etc as we all know it since our
childhoods.Disney didn&#x27;t waste runtime on establishing the plot and
only focused on its grand &#x22;portrayal&#x22;.Which is a good thing (And
exactly where Junglebook,Snowwhite n maleficient failed) There is this
&#x22;Be our guest&#x22; sequence which is breathtaking beautiful. It just
mesmerises for few seconds. Belle is dressed in a magical yellow gown
and beast comes up so elegantly there. Cogsworth,lumiere and chip
(living objects of the palace) are animated very cutely.I&#x27;d not compare
their expressions with the 1991 2D masterpiece though,inner child in me
loved them all! 3D effects and complimenting cinematography makes you
go awestruck quiet regularly till the end. The only thing which could
have been wayy better is the &#x22;music&#x22;. It wasn&#x27;t something unpleasant
,but this being a &#x22;musical&#x22;,needed freshness and not too stretched
singing solos and repetitive same old ensemble BGM we have heard
countless times elsewhere. All in all,i am very happy with this movie
and i can say that it will stay in my collection for years! This isn&#x27;t
the first time when Disney did a classic remake,this is indeed the
first time when Disney made me fall in love again!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Worth Watching<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and The Beast is an excellent movie to watch with your family
because not only it stays true to the original. But it stays true to
the fans of the animated version and will spawn a new generation of
fans in the time being. Otherwise Beauty and The Beast lives up to its
expectations and will continue to be one of the best Disney movies out
there.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An Outstanding Piece of Work!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty &#x26; the Beast stands, in my opinion, as one of Disney great
triumphs. Further, Emma Watson is purely magnificent and steals the
show! Gaston also adds wonder and wit. Most of the main characters act
splendidly, making the movie a joy to view. This movie pulls you in and
makes you a part of it! Overall, I give this movie a nine. A ten is not deserved for some
slightly odd CGI regarding the Beast. Other than that, the movie
enchants me, and I will see again and again.As for the critics that complain about the &#x22;gay&#x22; scenes. Bah! There&#x27;s
hardly a thing there. You might not even notice if you weren&#x27;t looking.
Kids certainly won&#x27;t know to what the very subtle innuendos
tangentially point. Indeed, you&#x27;d be silly not to see this work of art
for the purportedly &#x22;gay scenes.&#x22; GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Belle and Gaston alone make it worthy of a shot!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful and magical remake<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It was a very beautiful movie. Each element was perfect. They kept the
magic of the original and created even more magical elements with this
remake. The scenarios and costumes were marvelous. The music was splendid. The
colors and the environment that was created was exquisite.The acting could be a little better, but over all it was really good.
The cast reflected the essence of each original character and added
some new funny and good characteristics.So Disney lovers very recommended!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Fantastic remake of the original classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When I heard that Disney were going to remake Beauty and the Beast, I
was a bit sceptical as this is probably one of the most popular Disney
films ever made so it was difficult to see how they could live up to
the original and yet put a fresh spin on it. However, I am delighted to
say that this is a stunning and beautiful remake of the original Disney
classic.The cast was great and Emma Watson did a fantastic job in portraying
Belle. What truly amazed though, me was the incredible CGI effects on
Belle&#x27;s village and in particular the castle of the beast, of course
not forgetting the beast himself! The new songs they added were really
good as well as all the much loved songs from the original. I was
really surprised at the singing talent of the cast, particularly Emma
Watson and Luke Evans - I never knew either of them could sing so well!
I think adding new scenes like when Belle and the Beast travelled back
to her original home was good as it helps you to see more of Belle&#x27;s
backstory and what happened to her mother which you did not see as much
of in the original. Also, it was good how they filmed the opening
sequence of the film where the enchantress comes to the prince&#x27;s
palace, as in the original that was all told through narration and a
stained glass window. The comedy elements they added was a nice touch,
still keeping the light banter between Cogsworth and Lumi&#xE8;re.To be honest I can&#x27;t see what all the complaints are about. People
complained about Maleficent (which I agree was a poor film), saying how
it deviated from the original too much. Finally, Disney are sticking to
the original and still a ton of complaints. What were they supposed to
do? In my opinion this is a brilliant film and if you, like me are a
fan of the original then it is a must see film.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Don&#x27;t believe the haters - will go on to become one of the greats<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Whatever you do, under no circumstances, believe the haters. I have
read a few reviews so far and most are, sad to say, woefully and
shamefully inadequate. As most would know this is a remake of the 1991 Aminated classic.
Winner of Academy Awards and loved by generations, the animated musical
casts a long shadow. Any movie following in its footsteps has a lot to
live up to. Fortunately, the remake does this in spades.Beauty and the Beast (La Belle et la B&#xEA;te in the original french) was a
fairy tale published 1740 for the french court. Fairy tales were
popular in the French salons at the time. This version - a political
thriller of sorts - was later republished in 1756 by Jeanne-Marie
Leprince de Beaumont for children in the form that is known today. This
fairy tale, of the daughter of a merchant who is forced to move to the
country after her father loses their fortune, was not the version told
in the 1991 animated movie. To be clear, Disney did not re-invent BatB, but the story was
streamlined with elements removed and added to make the transition to
the silver screen. The inclusion of Gaston, who doesn&#x27;t appear anywhere
in either of the french versions, is an example of this streamlining.
Another is the rose, a pivotal part of the fairy tale, was changed into
a plot device. The problem with any streamlining is that sometimes elements are left
out that turn out to be needed to fill plot holes. A plot hole from
1991 - why was the beast &#x22;spoilt&#x22; and &#x22;cruel&#x22; before the curse? Who
knows. Another one - Why are Maurice and Belle so different to the town
folk? Don&#x27;t know. Or try this one - why did the Beast lock Maurice up?
Because ..... Yeah. It only took 26 years for a remake to come along,
and more importantly, a remake which fills the plot holes. And not only
fills them but fills them either with new story or even more
importantly with elements from the original fairy tale!Moreover, charges have been levelled against the movie of being a
shameless knockoff of the 1991 movie. To this, I have but one word to
say - MUSIC. To remake Beauty and the Beast without the songs that
earned its place in the hearts of an entire generation would be no less
than a crime. The story into which those songs fit, how much can it be
changed without the songs becoming irrelevant, or worse yet, out of
place? The answer - very little! This charge usually comes with the
accusation that certain scenes had been all but duplicated. What those
making such a charge fail to realise is that these scenes like the
music have become iconographic and inalienable to the Disney story. To
lose them would have created a gaping void in the finished product just
as changing or removing the songs would have. A symptom of the success
of the 1991 movie is that parts must be used in any remake if it is to
feel finished to the many, many who have grown up with the original.Other complaints from reviewers who have panned Beaty and the Beast
2017, unfortunately, get worse, more insignificant and more nit- picky,
from there. Unfortunately again it is a symptom of the success of the
original that there are so many ready to tear apart this remake by
sifting through the minutia to find a flaw.The remake of Beauty and the Beast took 26 years to come along and was
well worth the wait. It is the must see movie of 2017 and many years to
come.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>great movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I went into the film not expecting much. I was quickly taken in how
well this movie was done. Emma Watson is superb as Belle. The music was
good the effects where very good. The rest of the cast was brilliant as
well. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone especially if you
have teenage daughters as I do. Tale as old as time Beauty and the
Beast.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney does it again.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; was stunning and gorgeous. Beautifully and
artfully performed. Dazzlingly colorful and charming. Fresh and
lighthearted. Wonderfully and magically enthralling. I laughed, I
cried, I floated along with the music, I bawled and bawled as the
spellbinding elegance and splendor took me to another place and time. I
was 5 years old again enjoying the Wonderful World of Magic that is
Disney, as if for the first time. I will gladly spend my money over and
over to see that magic unfold. I willingly and happily concede Emma
Watson to be Belle, for this generation of children, instead of
Hermione. She has earned her place as a Disney princess and I applaud
everyone who had a part in this piece of magic. Truly, Disney knows how
to make us all children again.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An Absolute Delight!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;m rating this so highly (10 stars!) because I feel it is deserving of
the highest praise. To see so many reviewers berating this film is
quite a shock. I don&#x27;t see anything controversial about the tale as old
as time. In fact, I see lessons that people of all ages can learn from.
Not to judge others based on their appearances is one of those lessons
of note.I wish to commend the cast and crew at bringing this to screen in such
a grand and epic way. The music is beyond wonderful. I love Audra
McDonald&#x27;s singing, and I would love to hear even more. My favorite
musical number was &#x22;Be Our Guest!&#x22; That was an absolute spectacle and a
dream to behold. Emma was the perfect Belle. If I were in casting, she is the actress
that would have been my number 1 pick. She is the main reason why I
wanted to see this film. She sings quite nicely, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting
that. In fact, I didn&#x27;t expect this movie to be so musical. I really do
not remember much from the original 1991 animated film. I know I saw it
when it came out (I was a young one).I was very surprised to see so many adults, especially baby
boomer/retired age in the theater too. There were more adults than
children! I wonder what drew them?I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of Disney, of musicals,
of the original animated film, or Emma Watson. It was an nice
refreshing breath of air and break away from our current political
climate.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Unpopular opinion: This is better than the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The original Beauty and the Beast was my favorite cartoon as a kid but
it did have major plot holes. Why had no one else ever seen the castle
or knew where it was? Didn&#x27;t anyone miss the people who were cursed?
All of that gets an explanation when the enchantress places her curse
in the beginning. Why did Belle and her Father move to a small town?
Her mother died and the father thought it as best to leave. I love the
new songs and added lyrics to the originals. I like the way the cgi
beast looks (just the face is CGi). I think Emma Watson is a perfect
Belle who is outspoken, fearless, and different. The set design is
perfect for the era in France. I know a lot of people disagree but I found this remake with all its
changes to be more enchanting, beautiful, and complete than the
original 1991 movie. To each his own but I think everyone should see it
for themselves.

To say I&#x27;m a Disney fan is a tiny bit of an understatement &#x85;Where to start with this review? there is so much I want to rant and
rave about I literally don&#x27;t know where to begin.I suppose first of I should say, oh my goodness loved every single
moment of this movie. The goosebumps were constant and there wasn&#x27;t a
moment when a huge smile wasn&#x27;t plastered all over my face.THEY&#x27;VE KEPT IT TRUE TO FORM &#x96; and when I say that, I didn&#x27;t read the
bloody original fairy tale, but I&#x27;ve seen the animated Disney dream
around 200 times.They haven&#x27;t removed any key moments or tried to make things dark and
deep (which everybody seems to do these days) . They&#x27;ve added a little
more depth to certain characters and a wee little backstory to our
Belle&#x27;s background, but the tale really is as old as time &#x85;Just want to get one thing out in the open &#x96; I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Emma
Watson.Obviously Harry Potter is life, but for some reason I find her acting
&#x27;talents&#x27; seriously lacking, so when I heard she landed herself the
title role, I did a little face plant.In fact the only thing that kept me positive about the whole thing was
thinking &#x27;it could be worse, they could&#x27;ve given it to Anne Hathaway&#x27;In all honesty though, she is perfect for this part. She looks
gorgeous, her singing is pretty on point and her personality on and off
screen is a dead match.In fact the whole cast was perfect!Luke Evans is the stand out performance in the film for me, his singing
voice is ace and he oozes the arrogance and anger that Gaston needs.&#x27;I USE ANTLERS IN ALL OF MY DECOOOORATING&#x27;When you&#x27;ve been listening to the same songs for 25 years, it&#x27;s hard to
love any covers in the same way.Well that&#x27;s what I thought until now. Every musical moment is perfect.From the arm swinging Gaston to the slow dancing title track, they sure
did do it right.When the soundtrack was released, people were claiming the new
additions were mostly filler, and I don&#x27;t know what these crazies had
been smoking, but they must be out of their minds.&#x27;Evermore&#x27; stood out to me from the beginning, as I always thought that
the beast needed a song of his own and this is everything I could&#x27;ve
dreamed of. It&#x27;s so powerful, moving and YES, I DID CRY! JUST BACK OFF
OKAY?Blah blah blah, I could talk nonstop about the many, many ways this
ticked all the boxes for me but I&#x27;m going to cool my jets a bit now and
get down to it.I am confident that people will come out of this movie disappointed,
they&#x27;ll be wanting/expecting something fresh and different but I for
one am glad that&#x27;s it&#x27;s neither of those things.It&#x27;s not at all a straight imitation but at the same time it&#x27;s not
trying to be something that it&#x27;s not. To me they hit the nail on the
head and this movie is my absolute dream. Everything I was wanting and
more.My rating &#x96; 10/10 all day, every day. I have already booked to see it
again and I am counting down the days!!!Seeing it for the first time was an experience I won&#x27;t forget and I
would like to personally thank Disney for giving me yet another film I
can cherish forever.

Beauty And The Beast was filmed in England in London the capital of
England and the county of Surrey. Overall Beauty And The Beast is a
good Disney film filled with dancing, singing, good effects, stunning
spectacular scenes, some funny scenes, some action, some minor violence
nothing too serious or really violent, animals like beats, horses,
werewolves, hens, chickens, dancers, bakers, working class people,
rain, snow, sunshine, dark forests, an impressive looking castle where
the beast and his friends live, colourful things that make you go wow
this is amazing, love, passion, loyalty, friendship, family,
togetherness, magic, talking objects or things, outstanding
performances from Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans and Kevin Kline
and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Beauty And
The Beast an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Beauty
And The Beast is worth seeing if you like other Disney films like the
live version of Cinderella from 2015, Maleficent, Cinderella the
animated Disney version from 1951, Beauty And The Beast the animated
Disney version from 1991, Sleeping Beauty, Into The Woods amongst
others. So if you get the chance to see Beauty And The Beast in the
cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later but in my
opinion the new version of Beauty And The Beast is not as good as the
original Beauty And The Beast the Disney animated version from 1991
which is good but please still go and see the new live version of the
film and see if you like it or not and you will like it if you go to
see it in the cinema.

This movie was absolutely beautiful made! The songs and the costumes
were stunning and sent you right back to your childhood. In all
honestly, the only thing there drew the movie back was the casting of
the prince. When he transformed into a human again the whole theater
burst out laughing including the person I came with. Because well you
expect a handsome kind faced prince, but that was left with an empty
feeling of &#x22;eh?&#x22;. Not that the actor was extremely ugly, but he had a
very normal appearance, that he was a random guy from the grocery
store, just the everyday guy. Which isn&#x27;t bad ofc, just very
unexpected. I loved how Disney incorporated homosexual aspects in this
movie with LeFou and another male. Kudos to Disney for doing that, it
was very enjoyable also the fact that there are equal whites and blacks
in the movie, was great to see and couldn&#x27;t help smiling when I saw it
:)But definitely go see it anyways, just be prepared that you won&#x27;t be
wowed by the prince, apart from that this movie takes you right back to
your childhood and is worth going seeing.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Really fun and extremely charming!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Going into this movie, I had low expectations. I&#x27;d seen poor reviews,
and I also kind of hate the idea of remaking animated films for no
reason other than to make them live action, as if that&#x27;s supposed to
make them better some how. This movie pleasantly surprised me!Beauty and the Beast is a fun, charming movie, that is a blast in many
ways. The film very easy on the eyes! Every shot is colourful and
beautifully crafted. The acting is also excellent. Dan Stevens is
excellent. You can see him if you look closely at The Beast, but not so
clearly that it pulls you out of the film. His performance is suitably
over the top in anger, but also very charming. Emma Watson was fine,
but to be honest, she was basically just playing Hermione, and I didn&#x27;t
get much of a character from her. She likes books, and she&#x27;s feisty.
That&#x27;s basically all I got. For me, the one saving grace for her
character, is you can see how much fun Emma Watson is having. I&#x27;ve
heard interviews in which she&#x27;s expressed how much she&#x27;s always loved
Belle as a character, and it shows.The stand out for me was Lumier&#xE9;, voiced by Ewan McGregor. He was
hilarious, and over the top, and always fun! He lit up the screen (no
pun intended) every time he showed up!The only real gripes I have with the film are some questionable CGI
with the Wolves and with a couple of The Beast&#x27;s scenes, and some
pacing issues. The film flows really well, to such an extent that in
some scenes, the camera will dolly away from the character it&#x27;s
focusing on, and will pan across the countryside, and track to another,
far away, with out cutting. This works really well, but a couple times,
the film will just fade to black, and it&#x27;s quite jarring. It happens
like 3 or 4 times, but it&#x27;s really noticeable, and took me out of the
experience. Also, they added some stuff to the story that I don&#x27;t want
to spoil, but I don&#x27;t think it worked on any level, story wise, or
logically.Overall, it&#x27;s a fun movie! I would recommend it to any fan of the
original, but those who didn&#x27;t like the animated classic, or who hate
musicals might be better off staying away!84/100

I saw &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;, starring Emma Watson-My Week With
Marilyn, the Harry Potter movies; Dan Stevens-Legion_tv, Downton
Abbey_tv; Luke Evans-The Girl on the Train, Fast &#x26; Furious 6; Josh
Gad-Pixels, Love &#x26; Other Drugs and Kevin Kline-Ricki and the Flash.This is a live-action remake of the classic 1991 Disney film, which was
in turn, based on a French fairy tale. If you have fond memories of
that 1991 story then you should enjoy this version. It is a musical so
it contains new versions of those loved songs from the original, plus
it has a few new songs, too. The story is pretty much the same-don&#x27;t
judge a book by it&#x27;s cover-but it is also filled out more. For
instance, in the original, the origin of the Beast is told in narration
at the beginning of the movie, but here, it is actually shown. Emma
plays Belle, Kevin is her father Maurice, Dan is the Beast, Luke is
Gaston and Josh is his faithful sidekick LeFou. Oh, I should mention
that before the movie was even released, there was all kinds of talk
about there being a gay character in the movie and people being upset
about it-I even heard some people were going to boycott the movie. It&#x27;s
all ridiculous. The character in question is Josh/LeFou and things are
only hinted at that he likes Luke/Gaston. Nothing ever happens between
the two in any sort of gay fashion so you can relax. These rumors are
usually started by people that haven&#x27;t even seen the movie in the first
place-which irritates me to no end. Anyway, like I said earlier, if you
liked the original, then you will probably like this one, too. It&#x27;s
rated &#x22;PG&#x22; for action violence, peril and frightening images and has a
running time of 2 hours &#x26; 9 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on
DVD.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Breathtakingly Beautiful<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast was by far my favourite Disney film growing up.
So, naturally, I approached this live action version with some
trepidation. I was worried they would ruin a classic, destroy a
cherished childhood memory. Luckily they did not. Far from it in fact.Director Bill Conden and Co have treated it with respect and love. The
film they produced is gorgeous in it&#x27;s nuances and beautiful in it&#x27;s
imagery. The cast do a stellar job of bringing the characters to life,
developing their backstories and adding little twists and nods that
enhance our understanding of them.Even if some of the casting choices seemed a little unorthodox (Ewan
McGregor as Lumiere and Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts) at first they grow
on you and charm you as the film goes on. Indeed, the most unorthodox
bit of casting, Emma Watson as the princess of the piece, proved to be
the perfect choice for the role. Yes, admittedly, her singing could be
better but it was not as auto-tuned as the media claimed it was and
actually it sounds both lovely and sweet. Watson, herself, is lively
and charismatic shouldering the weight of the film, as Atlas shouldered
the world, with grace and delicacy. There was enough of Hermione in her
characterisation which were already parts of Belle&#x27;s character (the
love of books, kindness of heart and her yellow dress moment being a
grown up deja vu moment of the Yule Ball staircase scene in Goblet of
Fire)Another area of contention for the film, largely exaggerated by the
media, was the introduction of Disney&#x27;s first openly gay character in
LeFou. In my opinion he always was gay, anyway, so I didn&#x27;t see the big
deal about the live action version of him. The gay moments, of which
there are actually quite a few, are subtle and sweet and funny. A
moment in the battle with LeFou&#x27;s future love is really quite risqu&#xE9; by
Disney&#x27;s standards (Stanley loving how he looks in the fabulous dress)
but it, and the other moments, are treated with great gentleness by the
actors. I will admit that I was somewhat disappointed with the Be Our Guest
scene. That song is the showstopping moment in the cartoon version but
here, although it does its best and is a whirlwind of colour, has
something missing. They crammed several references to other Disney and
musical things within it and it rushes through without really taking a
breath. The boys steal the film. Gaston is wonderfully butch and stupid, but
also has backstory added with him being a war veteran. You can tell
that he genuinely cares for Belle but as LeFou points out he is the
real monster; hidden and now released. The Beast is magnificent. Again
he has backstory and it was nice to see him a little before the curse;
seeing how awful he was gives his character a good arc to redemption. I
defy anyone, male or female, not to fall in love with Dan Stephens in
this role. His rendition of Evermore is the highlight of the soundtrack
and I shall lose all faith in the awards panels if they do not give
that best song for every award going. Yes the Beast is cruel at first
but you fall in love with him as Belle does. Their chemistry is
wonderful and the moment after the transformation is heartbreakingly
beautiful in the subtlety of their acting. In this version I did not
prefer him as the beast to the prince, as I had with the cartoon
version. In the live action version I loved both of them.This is a wonderful film, both thrilling and uplifting. Just as Disney
ought to be. I sincerely hope they continue in this fashion and remake
many of their classics with the same love as they have with this Tale
as Old as Time.

Beauty and the beast is a total triumph. This is one of those movies
where you just can&#x27;t get enough of. That is how good this movie is. I
have seen a lot of good movies and this is one of the best by far. The
way this movie was directed was just pure remarkable it is truly a work
of art on the big screen. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and it had
stellar 3D. Emma Watson will steel your heart she is breathtaking as
Belle I just love her as Belle.Parents this is a Disney movie, but there is a guy character in it but
it is very very brief no more than 5 minutes long then it is over.
Besides that it was a great film that the little ones will love the
whole time. They added a lot of musical numbers that are absolutely
terrific every song is toe tapping the kids will love what Disney has
done to one of the best films ever createdBe our guest be our guest put our service to the test
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great Movie, One of the must see movies of 2017<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast a movie I have not seen since I was under 10 years
of age. Since I hadn&#x27;t seen it in so long I decided to go and see the
new reboot that Disney have done.In all honesty I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for it, but boy was I
wrong! I went to see it in IMAX Melbourne and was immersed into the
movies world the whole time. I don&#x27;t think I took my eyes off the movie
the whole time I was in the cinema.Although the movies story may have been a bit off, I think they made
this up with there perfect actor choices for the characters and the
amazing voices that they put forward in the beautiful songs that Beauty
and the Beast possesses.Emma Watson as Belle, Luke Evans as Gaston, Ewan Mcgregor as Lumiere
and Ian Mckellen as Cogsworth. Loved all of these characters and I
don&#x27;t think they could have picked anyone more perfect for the roles.To me this will be up there as one of the movies of 2017 and I will be
surely buying it when it comes out on DVD.I loved every single minute of this movie, it took me back to being a
kid again and I felt like I was in the movie itself following each
character in the story.If you love Disney and are not a nit-picking critic like so many people
out there then you will love this movie! 10/10 from me! :)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just WONDERFUL! So much charm added to the original version. This film left me in tears<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;ve always loved Disney movies. I grew up with them and i associate a
lot of childhood memories with them. the first time i went to the
cinema....sick days at home under the blanket watching
movies...birthdays, Christmas, memories that make me feel good thinking
about them.When i went to see Beauty and the Beast today I was skeptical at first
but it turns out that this movie is even more beautiful than the
original. I think that the makers of this movie added a lot of charm,
Emma Watson is a wonderful Belle and the music gave me goose bumps.This is definitely something I want to watch again and again and again
:)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Amazing experience for us Disney fans!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
For a huge Disney fan like me, this movie was truly amazing to watch!
The story (compared with the movie from 1991) had its&#x27; own touch with
some totally new scenes which added a even more deep touch but still,
as a fan, I could see many, many similarities between the both. Several
lines were identical to the original and so was the way many scenes
were cut. Lovely details only we who have seen the original a multiple
times could notice. The music was great but I did not really enjoy the
new songs. It felt a bit too much with so many songs and it would
totally be enough with just all the old ones and maybe one or two new
at most. Still, I got a great music experience and with the help from
the breathtaking scenery I even shed some tears to the songs &#x22;Belle&#x22; in
the beginning and the main theme &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; later in the
movie. Emma is doing a great job and I think she is totally perfect for
the role as Belle. So is Dan Stevens as the beast and I&#x27;m really
impressed of their work! This movie is really good on its own but for
us fans it&#x27;s even more than that. From the story, scenery, music and
the great actors we really get the right feeling from the 1991movie and
that is an experience worth 10/10.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>This new version of Disney&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast seemed just as excellent as the previous animated version<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
For weeks, part of me dreaded watching this mostly literal Disney
live-action remake of its deservedly praised and Oscar-nominated
animated version from 1991. Now that I&#x27;ve seen it, I was mostly
enthralled with what I saw. The songs are as well-performed as ever and
the added ones don&#x27;t make the movie too long. The CGI used to animate
the inanimate objects were also pretty charming. And the actors cast
for the story were very compelling to watch. I remember crying in
several spots, that&#x27;s how much I enjoyed it. And the Dolby screen I saw
it on was also a wonderful treat for me and my movie theatre-working
friend who had watched it before but not on Dolby. There were some
added lines that explained some things more clearly so that was another
thing I liked about this version. To tell the truth, I&#x27;d probably have
to watch the other version again to make comparisons so for now I&#x27;d say
I like each version equally. So that&#x27;s a high recommendation of this
version of Beauty and the Beast.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Be our guest? Certainly!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Over all, I was quite pleased with the movie. I was most impressed with
Luke Evan&#x27;s portrayal as Gaston and Ewan McGregor&#x27;s portrayal as
Lumiere. All of the other actors did a phenomenal job in their roles as
well. I think that Dan Stevens was the perfect actor to play the role
of Beast in his beastly form, but also as the Prince as well. As with
all movies, I always think that something could have been filmed
better, or an actor could have done more better. I felt the same thing
about Emma Watson as Belle. She certainly is the perfect choice for
such a role and there is now a whole new generation who are going to
associate her as Belle instead of Hermione from Harry Potter. (Same
with Dan Stevens I&#x27;m sure. There&#x27;s a new generation that now knows him
as Beast instead of Mr. Crawley from Downton Abbey). But I found Belle
a tad-bit boring in this live action. One of the most significant
things about Belle is that she is a big reader. She loves books, and
this is one of the roots of her being an independent-minded young woman
(aside from her being the only child raised by her father). I feel like
they could have put some more emphasis on her love for reading as this
is one of the primary attributes we notice about Belle&#x27;s character in
the animated version. Emma Watson, an outspoken Feminist herself
certainly did an incredible job adding those things to Belle that are
empowering otherwise.Luke Evans&#x27; Gaston was one of the portrayals that really surprised me.
I love it how he added a bit of a sly side to him whereas, in the
animated version he&#x27;s all 100% masculine and domineering kind of
person, someone who always gets what he wants. The live action Gaston
has the same masculine and cocky kind of attitude, but the sound of
Luke&#x27;s voice and how he acted him in the movie, I really felt added a
good amount of slyness to his villainy. It really gave off that &#x22;evil
parading itself as a prince&#x22; kind of feeling. Lumiere is the other
character I was really impressed with. Lumiere has been my favorite
character out of the whole story since I was little. I loved his rather
more flamboyant, entertaining spirit. I also really loved it that they
put more emphasis on his relationship with Plumette in this live action
version. Lumiere certainly added a nice blend of refreshing
entertainment in my opinion.A lot of things have been said about Lefou, I read my fair share of
outrage from people about him being a gay character. Lefou really
reminded me of another character from a very different movie. Billy
Breckenridge played by Jason Priestly in the movie Tombstone. I
certainly didn&#x27;t have any issues with that, and I think that Lefou
added a great deal of humor to the movie. My advise to the folks who
are repulsed by Lefou&#x27;s sexual orientation would be to re-watch the
animated version as there are plenty of hints of his sexual orientation
in that version. At the end of it all, it&#x27;s really up to the person as
to what they want to watch, what they want their kids to watch.
However, I do promise you, if you chose to see this movie with your
kids, they aren&#x27;t going to notice anything out of the ordinary other
than this is a good and fun movie.Would I recommend this film to anyone? Certainly!

At first I was skeptical about this movie, and then, month by month, I
started to get very hyped and excited. Nevertheless, I still had my
doubts regarding the director - I mean seriously, Twilight?
Seriously?!? What was Bill Condon thinking when he accepted to involve
himself in that sparkly mess? And of course, this extended to Emma
Watson and Dan Stevens, as I could not imagine them worthy of playing
my all time favorite characters from my favorite movie... Yes, I
followed Dan&#x27;s career since he played Edward Ferrars in &#x22;Sense and
Sensibility&#x22; and I am a convinced Potterhead so Emma&#x27;s acting skills
were never in question. I even postponed watching it because I was sooo afraid of spoiling the
picture perfect created by the 1991 version, and also because I had
read some reviews that were not so favorable...Nevertheless, last Sunday I went to the theater, heart in my teeth,
stomach in knots, expecting a big letdown. But, something magical
happened from the very first scene. I forgot how to breathe properly, I
barely blinked, entranced as I was by this marvelous piece of
cinematography. I cried, squealed with delight, laughed, sobbed, sang
along when my favorite tunes started and listened to the new ones
breathlessly... I felt my heart grow heavy so many times, feeling I&#x27;m
still experiencing on a daily basis whilst listening to the
soundtrack... Every moment, every image, every song, it all combines in an unique
experience, enhanced by the 3D technology, compelling many of us to
re-experience it again, and again, and again. Ultimately, my advice is to go watch this movie, with an open heart and
you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Haters will be haters, they will continue to
bash this movie, write negative reviews and advice against it. Don&#x27;t
follow my example, don&#x27;t listen to my advice, do the smart thing and
experience it yourself and then let your heart decide....
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Outstanding!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I seriously can&#x27;t quite figure out why this movie doesn&#x27;t have a 10/10
average. There are no flaws with the film. Score was great, cast was
great, acting was great, plot was great, execution and directing 100%
great as well as the sound mixing and overall color grading. The movie
IMHO was perfect. I believe we need to start rating movies on flaws
rather than basing our opinions off of preconceived notions from
nostalgia. The movie on it&#x27;s own was fantastic, even trying not to
think or bias it from the original animated version. The problem with
these sub-par reviews from other viewers that clearly have bias, is
that they are contributing to Hollywood creating more terrible films.
Disney needs to know that this movie was fantastic and most people
generally loved it. If the industry thinks the movie wasn&#x27;t that great
based off of reviews, then they will change their future movies for the
worse. 10/10, fantastic. Take it from a film composer, gamer, and movie
lover.

I saw it opening day. This movie was great. Love the animated one grew
up on it, didn&#x27;t think this one would be as good because its just not
the same as animation but it was incredible. everything from the
characters/ Actors, music, wardrobe everything, defiantly a must see
for everyone.

Tasteful, true the original and very well cast. It didn&#x27;t need to be a
CGI fest, it&#x27;s a classic Disney. Jungle Book had virtually none of the
original songs which was a huge disappointed. It felt as though there
was a respect for the film unlike other remakes. Of course people find
some way to bash it but its an absolute masterpiece and should be
enjoyed by all.

Beauty and the beast! The beast (pun intended) movie I&#x27;ve seen this
year! The casting choice is just brilliant!! Emma Watson brings this
charming and incredibly sweet side of belle. The songs are so good that
I have downloaded them all! I had an excellent time watching this movie
(twice) and I recommend you all go see it! The setting and the tiny
changes they made in the movie make a huge difference and really for
the best! I have no real words to describe this adorable and fun movie!
Just go watch it!!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Magical in every way<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast was my most favorite Disney movie ever and hearing
the news that it&#x27;s going to be with real actors...oh my gosh -I
couldn&#x27;t wait! And the movie met my expectations more than I could ever
wished for!! Generally I loved the thing that it was so close adapted
to the original...I think that was the purpose: To bring to the next
generations as perfect as it was, but with the necessary fresh twist.
From the first moment you hear the intro music, you feel the trigger of
emotions in your spine....and it gets into you till the very
end...Laughing, singing, crying....all the emotions you could feel
watching the original, were all coming back, even stronger. Seeing your
favorite characters come to life, makes it even more intense. The
actors\actresses chosen couldn&#x27;t be more perfect for their roles! Emma
Watson was like she was born to be Belle...and so was Dan Stevens! His
voice, his eyes..were a perfect match with the Beast! Josh Gad...?!! Oh
my gosh...If there weren&#x27;t those 26 years between this and the
original, I would swear that the made LeFou watching Josh! Sooo
identical! Luke Evans? Perfect! And all the rest as well. Plus there
were so many extra elements in the movie that filled us some story gaps
from the original, like what was like the Prince before the
transformation or why did Belle and her father were so different from
the rest of the villagers...And of course there are some new songs,
which we are going to love equally I believe. Also all the technical
stuff in there was so unbelievably amazing!...The castle, the rooms
inside, the costumes...everything was made with perfect detail! Many
times I got myself distracted from the characters staring the dazzling
objects on the background. So, don&#x27;t even hesitate a little...Watch and
enjoy this wonderful movie!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Perfect Adaption of the Original Cartoon<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This is the best and the perfect adaption of the original cartoon in
the 90s. It has some extension to the sound track and scenes, but
they&#x27;re there to build up the perfect emotion for viewers to fall in
love with the characters. And I just must say that Emma Watson is truly
the perfect selection to play as Belle. She&#x27;s charming and just pure
perfect! Ignore any bad reviews you see in here. If you liked the
original cartoon, then you&#x27;ll desperately fall in love with this one.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Had just as much charm, maybe more<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. The criticisms I&#x27;ve read are
trivial at best. This was a great movie. In fact, it was a perfect
rendition of an all-time classic Disney movie. What made it so well-
rounded was the fact that they stayed true to the 1991 original with a
few added scenes that explained the story further.It was a wonderful movie. Don&#x27;t listen to these wannabe movie critics.
Just go and enjoy.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Best Disney Remake Yet!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie was exceptionally great so a 10 in the ratings is a
definite! The cast was great, the score was great, the acting was
great, and the real life remake is surprisingly parallel to the
original Beauty and the Beast. Emma Watson and Dan Stephens did not
disappoint. Go see it! You won&#x27;t regret it!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Director drops the ball<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First: Bill Condon making huge mistakes in this movie. Animations bad i
mean very bad. Beast face unbearable.Second: Cast choices are bad except Emma Watson. She is good but not
great.Finally: I think Disney making huge mistake hiring Bill Condon for
this.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It is the number 1 Disney films<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It is so good that I think it should bethe number 1 Disney films that are very good. It is very interesting
and very fantasy.I recommend it for families, people who are very musical and people who
like fantasies. It is very enjoyable too.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The way the film should had been in 1991<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Well the film may only be released just over a quarter of a century
after the original version but it certainly is a much better movie than
the the original.Pros Cast made of some well known movie celebrities, Brilliant visual
effects, some plot holes and puzzles from original film answered.Cons To similar to the original film, a bit to dark for children, songs
not as great as the original film.Well when I learned via internet back in 2015 a live action remake of
Beauty and the Beast was going to be made I was simply over the moon. I
am a guy and even though like Frozen and the recent Cinderella movie it
will mostly be girls that will be watching the movie I for one was not
going to miss this flick and I am glad I seen it. I waited nearly 2
years for this film to be released and I kept thinking this film was
never going to be released but I will download it when it is available
via iTunes and I will see it again and again. I am a big fan of Beauty
and the Beast and it is one of 2 Disney Princess movies I like the
other being Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which is apparently in the
works to be a live action Disney movie as well. I grew up watching
Beauty and the Beast that came out in 1991 the year I was born and I
admit the original film may have been a bit to &#x27;young&#x27; to get the live
action treatment as it is nearly only 26 years old but we all know that
most Disney cartoon movies are getting the live action treatment.I do agree with most critics the remake is simply a direct remake of
the cartoon as Belle is a young girl who swaps places with her father
Maurice in a castle the home of a prince who has been turned into a
Beast and must win her love to break the spell before the last petal
falls otherwise he will be cursed for entirety. There is of course
Luimier, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, Chip, Le Fou and of course last but not
least the jock villain Gaston because after all &#x27;Noone can be a villain
in this film like Gaston&#x27;.In my opinion despite the film being to similar it is much better than
the 1991 version and I swear to God Bill Condon has made the film the
way it should had been in 1991. If Bill Condon was not going to be
director my other choice would be Tom Hooper director of Les Misables
as that musical was also set in France. I would had also considered
Eddie Redmayne for the role of Beast but Dan Stevens did a great job as
Beast. He did a terrific job singing the original song &#x27;For Evermore&#x27;
which I think should get a nomination next year for best original song.
He sounded so much like Beast in the original film but I was slightly
disappointed he did not speak to Belle when he returned to his human
self. Emma Watson also did a great job as Belle except for the singing
as that was not as great as Paige O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s but she did a good job
playing the main female character in the film. Luke Evans was not too
bad but I felt he lacked the body-build Gaston had in the 1991 version
but he was much more darker and evil in this film. I know a lot of
people thought Le Fou was not that evil but in my opinion he was though
not quite at the same level as his animated counterpart. Still both
Luke Evans and Josh Gad showed great chemistry in the film but if I was
to pick the actor to play Le Fou it be Ben Whishaw as he is gay in real
life as was Le Fou in this film. The servants were alright but they
never had a quite as a big a role in this film than the 1991
adaptation. For example Cogsworth and Chip don&#x27;t get as much screen
time this time around and I felt also Ewan MacGregor had more of a
slight German accent than a French accent but he had fun playing
Luimier . As for Mrs Potts her singing just was not as great as Angela
Lansbury&#x27;s for the theme song of Beauty and the Beast and I think
either Julia Walters or Imelda Staunton could had replaced fellow Harry
Potter star Emma Thompson for the role. Kevin Kline did a brilliant job
as Maurice and had much more screen time than his cartoon counterpart.As I said the film was much better than the 1991 version but the songs
especially Be our Guest and Tale as old as Time were just not the same
as the original versions. As I mentioned Emma was not a great singer
but she did a great job as Belle. What I did like was that she was
simply stunning in her yellow ballroom dress. Emma simply looked like a
cracker with her bare arms and her hair when she wore the dress. I did
not like her peasant dresses very much but other than that she was
stunning.As I said I thought the film was much better than the cartoon version
as Condon made the film the way it should had been in 1991. We finally
learn why the prince became rude and snobbish and unkind. We learn why
Belle and Maurice moved to the village here named Villienueve after
Belle&#x27;s mother died in a plague and what I did like was that each time
a petal fell the servants become less human.I would recommend this film to anybody and Bill Condon you did a
brilliant job bringing this film to life.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Did Original Justice, Despite Poor Direction<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;ll start by mentioning that I adore the original animation, rating it
as my #1 Disney film. When I heard this was coming out, I was extremely
excited. I had no idea what to expect and avoided the trailers because
I wanted to keep an open mind - something that turned out to be very
necessary!First I&#x27;ll start with a few weaker points.The absolute killer for me was the general feel. It was nowhere near as
vibrant as it should have been and I didn&#x27;t feel enough contrast
between the first and second halves. When I found out that the director
of some Twilight films was involved, everything became very clear. At
some points it just felt so grey and not very Disney-like and I truly
think that poor direction held this production back. Especially some of
the happier scenes in the castle - I was sitting thinking &#x27;Jesus, isn&#x27;t
the saturation a little bit off&#x27;. I know it&#x27;s supposed to be gloomy,
but isn&#x27;t the whole film really about finding beauty in unlikely
places? That being said, the scene where Belle is racing through the
gardens after being released was stunning.Secondly the portrayal of a gay man for comic relief was distasteful
and a little insulting. Props to Disney for having the guts to include
this, however I can&#x27;t help feeling that it was more for publicity than
anything else. The whole thing with that musketeer being dressed as a
woman was completely stupid and shortsighted; the same ridiculous
clich&#xE8; that the community tries so hard to cast off. If you&#x27;re going to
include a gay character, make it a full part of a story and not just
comic relief or a fleeting scene obviously added to tick boxes. It was
all quite irrelevant to be honest.Lastly with the negatives - I didn&#x27;t completely love the effects. I
thought the cartoony feel was charming and not something I expected.
Personally I felt this worked well - although the town felt more
charming than anything else and I felt myself asking Belle, &#x27;is it
really that awful?&#x27;. On the other hand, it somewhat seemed a half-done
job; halfway between an animation and live-play. The enchanted objects
in the castle had really strange faces that didn&#x27;t convey the
comforting characters they&#x27;re supposed to be but their bodies (for lack
of a better word) were rather well animated. The Beast was a bit
strange to look at too and felt half-baked. There was without a doubt,
room for improvement there. The castle, however; was breathtaking and
did the animated version the justice it deserved.An area which I&#x27;m quite undecided on is Emma Watson as Belle. I adore
her as an actress; I think she has some real talent but I can&#x27;t work
out whether she was right for the role. On one side she conveys the
small-town girl role who wants adventure very well. Her inquisitive
side is very believable and it&#x27;s very clear she doesn&#x27;t fit in. On the
other side i don&#x27;t really think she has the warmth of the original
Belle; it was as if she cared more about rebelling and staying in the
castle than about her feelings for the Beast. This is NOT a criticism
of her acting at all - what she did, she did well despite the poor
direction. I just believe there could have been a better fit.Acting-wise the standout roles were probably Gaston and Lumiere&#x27;s voice
acting. They really carried the film in my opinion; Gaston was
definitely more comedic than the original but this was a welcome
addition. Lumiere was the perfect host and despite the questionable
animation, was still the same charming character as before. I don&#x27;t
think any of the acting was particularly weak - still room for more
believability but I blame the silly choice of directors - why choose
the director of a cheap, wooden, gloomy series about vampires and
werewolves for a vibrant Disney epic?The film stays true to its roots and whilst it doesn&#x27;t add much, what
it did add worked really well. For example the book which took Belle
back to Paris was something that really built upon her character, even
if it was a little bit far-fetched. It answered some questions which
were left unanswered before. Something I really missed was the Beast&#x27;s roar as Belle ran from the
castle after letting her free. It&#x27;s small, I know, but was incredibly
powerful in the original. They could have saved themselves the effort
of writing that extra song and portrayed the same pain.Overall a good adaptation which somehow kept the charm of the original
despite being held-back by poor choice of directors. Lots of room for
improvement but certainly not a waste of time or money. Please also
ignore these family-friendly negative comments. The &#x27;gay&#x27; scene (it
feels like a total joke even calling it this) lasted for probably not
even a second and should have been cut anyway as it was totally
pointless. Like I said, if you&#x27;re going to include inclusive
relationships, don&#x27;t force it into a classic and do it properly! If
girls were discouraged from reading and learning, I&#x27;d hardly expect
anyone to be open- minded enough to accept a same-sex relationship.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful Retelling of a Classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The only reason I did not give this film a 10 was because it does not
surpass the original. This film is brilliant on so many levels. Kevin
Kline, Emma Watson, Josh Gad, and Dan Stevens bring so much more depth
to their characters and enhance the story we already love. Alan Menken
adds some beautiful new pieces that add more emotion to the story. The
few complaints I had with the movie were minor and didn&#x27;t affect the
real experience of the movie. Overall this is a great retelling of a
classic with some modern twists.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty &#x26; the Kevin Kline<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Okay.I&#x27;m a huge fan of Kevin Kline.With that being said, he was the star of this film. He held it all
together and if he wasn&#x27;t present in the cast the movie would have
fallen apart completely.I haven&#x27;t seen the movie yet but guys, it&#x27;s Kevin Kline. I mean, he was
in Wild Wild West AND No Strings Attached. Go see this movie. Pay $14
at AMC to see it IMAX 3D. I know I will. For Kevin.Thanks, guys.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A really good film overall<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
For people who want something reworked and entirely new, I didn&#x27;t think
this was it. But if you want to see a human adaptation of the classic,
I think that this is a very good version. I thought it was a great
movie. There are a few little twists and turns that change it up just
enough to keep you wondering. As for La Fou and the concerns that some
have had about the film&#x85;. Truth is, the movie does not make him
&#x27;flaming&#x27; and there are very subtle, and very few, references to his or
any characters sexuality. I saw this movie with a few moms and the
scene that no one had seen yet, but had the fit about, could easily be
passed off as something else. We even heard a child of about 8 years
old ask her mother after the movie, &#x22;So what was the thing that
everyone was all flipping out about?&#x22; If you want to sing along (in
your head) and tap your feet, this is a good movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the animation, but something in me changed<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Something about this film filled my heart with many emotions I only
wish for other films to fill. I won&#x27;t take too much time, but it was
beautifully shot, the effects were wonderful (and I am not kind with
bad effects trust me) and a story with lots of charm and humor and
magic to keep you entertained throughout its entire run. A great
picture indeed, I hope you enjoyed it too!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Loved it!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Why such hatred??? I went to see this movie with my mother, we both
loved it a lot. I was honestly afraid they would change a lot of
things, but no, even the songs were almost line to line the same! There
are two small parts about Belle&#x27;s and the Beasts back story, but it
fits perfectly into the overall story-line and it&#x27;s such a minor thing
that even if you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s easy to skip. The characters, the
place remained the ever-amazing classic. For me, this was a perfect
refresh of an old story I loved as a child, and it was amazing to see
how they made a cartoon into an actual movie!

I don&#x27;t care what people think about this movie, for me, it was one of
the best movies I ever watched. Love it from start to finish. I give it

Love him!! Is the best movie for this awful time that we are live in.

Oh my god! I am in total love with this movie! It&#x27;s funny though
because when I go to bed, I think about Beauty and the Beast so I can
have a dream about it! People, trust me best romantic, Disney movie
ever! I love this movie! I&#x27;ve watched this movie twice in the movie
theaters now!! Crazy fan! Number 1 Fan! Love this movie! My favorite
part of it is at the end of the movie when the beast tries to come to
Belle, climbing towers. But, then Gaston ruins it! Anyways, I actually
cried during this movie! That&#x27;s how good it was! Not good, great! Love
this movie! Beauty and the Beast is the meaning of true love. Not
caring about looks but looking at what the true meaning of someone is
what that counts!! Plz best romantic Disney movie ever made!! Best
romantic Disney movie! Best couple ever! Oh my god! I&#x27;m just in love
with this movie! This is why I&#x27;m rating it ten out of 10 stars. If
there was an option of infinity, I would click it without hesitation.
So cute! They are so cute in the movie! Once more, best, romantic,
Disney, movie ever! It&#x27;s my favorite movie! Thank you for reading my
review!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Best movie I have seen in a long time.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. This version gave
all of the characters deeper meanings which made them relatable. The
singing was superb.The scenery was stunning. The costumes were so
detailed. Emma Watson was a superstar, she looked beautiful, her
personality shined and she was just the perfect Belle. A Fantastic
watch, highly recommend.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Loved it!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I know there are a lot of bad reviews out there for this film. However
i would urge anyone to go see it before you make a judgement. The
original Disney film is my favourite film (of all time) by far, so this
one had a lot to live up to. Personally i absolutely loved it!! I had a massive smile on my face the
whole time, and was exhilarated by most of the song and dance
numbers.Be my guest was particularly spectacular!! The magic is not
lost at all, in fact the back story is fleshed out and adds to the
film. The characters are fabulous and very well cast. Emma Watson i
thought&#x200B; was good but not spectacular, but didn&#x27;t distract from the
magic at all. Gaston i loved, was very sinister. Please go see this film with the original in mind but not expecting it
to be exactly like the original because that&#x27;s ridiculous and not
possible. The original is magical for what it is, but cinema moves on
and this is a beautiful retelling of the story. No Disney film will
ever be the same as the original but that&#x27;s not the point. This is
beautiful and magical and made me feel the same as watching the
original and you can&#x27;t say much better than that! I suspect most people seeing this film at cinema will not remember most
of it, like me, but i intend to acquire a copy as soon as legally
possible, and rewatch. Go watch this film!! You will love it i promise! Just don&#x27;t expect an
exact remake of the original!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Very amazing and fun film<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This by far was worth seeing as a Disney fan this was very good the
sones where catchy, the battles where spot on, the ending was worth it,
by far this was a very fun film to watch and I give it a 10 Star rating
cause it desvere&#x27;s it, there&#x27;s even comedy in it, im hoping there is a
sequel or prequel or something even a set of films cause I want to see
more of these. :)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I feel sorry for those disliking this movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I just saw it in a very good 3d cinema. I was not expecting much, given the director.(The Twilight &#x22;saga&#x22; was
horrible in my opinion). Big surprise, I loved the movie from the start. The cinematography is
fantastic. The cast is great, the music (the original themes are here),
the choreography of the dance scenes, the surroundings, the CGI,
everything is just how it should be in such a story. Some complained about the Beast;s face, he s quite OK, he&#x27;s a beast
after all, not a likable fellow. And they tried to make it a live
version of the beast from the cartoon.Others complained about the cast for Belle. She did a good job, the
only problem is that she can&#x27;t sing. Her singing is the only down side
of the movie, but I could pass this aspect very easy.Some complained about the gay scenes. Those are incredibly hilarious.
You have to be a complete imbecile to be offended by those.Some complained that the movie is too much alike the original cartoon.
In a different case, they would have been upset that the movie is
altering the story. Speaking of the casting, everyone was great, but Gascon was maybe the
best cast of the movie.Watch it on a good 3d cinema and I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy this movie that
was applauded at the end in my cinema. Long time since I witnessed
applause at the end of a movie.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>THANK YOU Disney<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney, please know that putting the same musical elements in the live
adaptations movies= great success. It&#x27;s not just about how everyone looks and okay, great now we have
actual people... but if the same songs aren&#x27;t in there, then there&#x27;s
not that classic &#x22;Disney&#x22; feel. It&#x27;s basically not the same movie. It&#x27;s
not as loved and nostalgic. But with Beauty and the Beast, when the
movie opened up to the story of the Beast and then the title and then
the provincial town--exactly like the animated movie-- with seemingly
the same song taken from the animated to the live, old to the new,
classic to modern, that&#x27;s when my heart started smiling. Thanks so much, watching Beauty and the Beast, I had a great time c:
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Love it!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;ve read the reviews with the lower ratings and just want to scream!
This movie is given low rating because of the CGI face of the Beast and
other production issues. Can&#x27;t you just watch this movie with your
heart and your inner child&#x27;s mind and not review it with your
techno/computer brain? Sorry if you don&#x27;t like the CGI and other stuff,
but I loved the movie!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Worth the wait<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
With one of the first Beauty and the Beast being one of my favourite
films this didn&#x27;t disappoint! A great live action version with some
amazing musical numbers! Ignore the bad reviews if you loved the first
one you will love this! I went to see this twice in one weekend as I
couldn&#x27;t wait to see this film again!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The Message is &#x27;Beauty is Only Skin Deep&#x27;<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This is a live action film (incorporating CGI animation), a remake of a
classic with some tweaks here and there to make it a little more
modern. I doubt whether anyone is unfamiliar with the plot (but just in
case) here a summary &#x85; The main protagonist is a very handsome but selfish prince, who is
&#x27;ugly on the inside&#x27;. A beggar woman comes to the castle and offers the
prince a rose, and asks for shelter, she is turned away and laughed at,
she decides there is no love in the prince&#x27;s heart. She is angry and
reveals herself to be a witch, she casts a spell on the Prince and his
staff making him into the &#x27;ugly on the outside&#x27; Beast. The staff are
all turned into pieces of furniture and antiques etc. They will all
stay that way forever until someone declares their love for the Beast
before the last petal of the rose falls.(Don&#x27;t worry it all works out
in the end)The actors have all been perfectly cast. Belle is Emma Watson, the &#x27;bookish&#x27; feminist, her character is an
anti-princess and very close to her Hermione character from Harry
Potter, though not a great singer.The Beast is Dan Stephens, he is excellent and has a great singing
voice.Gaston is Luke Evans, he is big and very bold, he has great charisma
but is very egotistical.Gaston&#x27;s manservant is Josh Gad, he appears to be overly familiar with
Gaston, but not in an overbearing way. This is in a similar way that
Smithers, from the Simpsons, is with Mr Burns.Parents need to be careful if they have younger children, the Beast
character might be a little scary for a younger audience, the wolf
attack scene definitely might be a little too scary.The film will definitely engage with a &#x27;20 something&#x27; viewer
(especially a girl) who will have loved the original animated version.I will definitely view again and recommend this film.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Ignore the incorrect &#x22;parent review&#x22;. Movie was a nice homage.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
There was absolutely none such &#x22;disturbing homosexual scene&#x22; that the
Parent Review warns of. If you watched the original Disney version you
are already aware of the hinted attraction that exists. But rest
assured the same insinuation exists that will go over most kids heads.
The alarmist incorrect warning here is merely that, alarmist and
incorrect.As for the movie content itself it was fantastic unless you were hoping
for an absolute carbon copy with no changes to actors or content or
song. If you were expecting a clone, you will not be happy.Thankfully I was looking forward to an homage with enough original
tweaks to make it interesting while being familiar but also a little
new. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The actors were great choices for each role
and while there was plenty of CGI, the images weren&#x27;t corny and it&#x27;s
amazing to see what nearly 20 years of cgi advancement can do while
staying true to the era.

It&#x27;s a wonderful and beautiful film from beginning to end, it&#x27;s an
amazing adaptation that thrilled, I really enjoyed the new scenes that
I added. A perfect cast, Emma Watson and Dan Stevens beautiful and I
liked them very much, they had a very good chemistry; But the ones that
I loved the most were Luke Evans and Josh Gad, they are the most
perfect pair, my favorites. Every exciting song, photography, costumes,
visually amazing, 3D works very well. The dance scene made me so
excited, my favorite scene was to see it and remember the animation. An
incredible movie, adapted perfectly, made me laugh, cry and enjoy a
lot. I totally recommend It.

I recently saw the beauty and the beast by Bill Condon. It&#x27;s a musical,
romantic and fantasy film which produced by Walt Disney Pictures in
2017 and lasted 129 minutes. This movie is set in U.S.A, it tells the
story of Belle played by Emma Watson . The story begins an enchantress
witch transforms the prince into a monster and the servants into
household objects and to break the spell , the price must learn to love
and earn the love in return before the rose&#x27;s last petal falls . And
one day a beautiful girl named Belle saved this monster and fallen in
love with it. Personally, i think that is a wonderful movie i would recommend it
because it&#x27;s credible .
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A New Classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;m a 80s kid so I grew up with the original Beauty and the Beast,
which means I also watched it hundreds of times. It was such an
empowering movie for a young impressionable girl, because Belle was
&#x22;different&#x22; and smart and loved to read, which was not something
Hollywood liked to portray about girls or women.Anyways, on to the live action BatB.. I absolutely loved it! I rarely
go out and watch movies in the theater these days but I went and
watched this one. I couldn&#x27;t wait and I was pleasantly surprised. I
went into this visual experience super excited and I definitely enjoyed
myself thoroughly. As soon as the original opening BatB song started
playing in the beginning, my heart was practically leaping out of my
chest, I teared up and a wave of nostalgia took me back to my
childhood. It was such a melancholy yet warming sensation. The movie was fun, had a bit more backstory than the original cartoon
version, was very well casted, had new surprises but mostly kept to all
the original magic that I loved as a child and even now when I think
about BatB. A beautiful display of cinematography leaves this one as a
shining star that will be as loved as the classic.Oh and about the gayness, it was so minor and silly, people shouldn&#x27;t
let that stop them from seeing this masterpiece.. trust me God won&#x27;t
strike you down!**The Following May Contain Spoilers**My faves.. The characters: As I stated above, this movie was very well
casted IMO. Belle, well of course, it was the wonderful, smart Emma
Watson and she was so refreshing. Her simple beauty and crisp voice
really made her the perfect Belle. I loved how Belle was so strong and
fierce in this movie. Gaston! Where do I begin.. Luke Evans is such a
hunk, I always had the hots for him in any movie I watched with him in
it.. well he certainly fit the bill for Gaston! Also, he can sing and
his voice seemed perfect for the part. Lefou was another favorite of
mine, played by Josh Gad. He was perfect and really paralleled the
cartoon Lefou in a lot of ways. Lumiere is the last I&#x27;ll gush about.. I
was surprised that he was vocalized by Ewan McGregor but what a great
job he did. A few misses.. Not really the actors fault but no one can replace
Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts, sorry.. she&#x27;s the bomb and I like the
old Cogsworth better but Ian McKellan gave it his best (still on the
top with Magneto and Gandalf though!).The ending was also really special. Of course I knew what was going to
happen in the end, but when all the servants, i.e. household furniture,
were being permanently turned into furniture, I cried. It was a really
touching moment and I loved how they were all saying their good- byes,
it was really sad (even though I knew the spell would be broken!).Overall, I think it was the perfect live action version of the &#x22;tale as
old as time&#x22;. I couldn&#x27;t have left happier and filled with peace than
after I watched this movie.

From Disney to Emma Watson worth performance Just three words: Disney,
epic and monumentalA love to see Emma out of Harry Potter Series as a beauty cause she isThis movie is needed to watch in all ages, when Disney comes to Epic in
any way
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful, heart-warming, loved it.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The movie felt like a lovely live action edition of the classic cartoon
movie from 1991, with a fitting modern touch. I love that they managed
to capture the charm and magic of the story in the way they did, from
the songs to the effects to the beast itself. I was actually scared at
first that the Beast would look silly (had not seen trailers), but when
finally seeing him, loved what they had done. I did not expect the
movie to stay so true to the original toon, while also helping
understand some potential plot holes from the original (in a way that
makes perfect sense). Overall, loved it. Am glad i went to see it. And
i&#x27;m a guy, in case you were wondering....and still liked it.Some people hate on the acting, cgi, story etc.. I say Do Not Listen..
I liked the original, loved this one. The acting is good, the cgi is
smooth, the story stays true. They wanted the movie to be lifelike and
yet retain the original &#x22;technicolor&#x22; charm, hence the vivid tones and
effects.. It&#x27;s not like this is some Maleficent situation, which
completely remade everything just to feature the main character&#x27;s
actor.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The best Disney movie for a long time!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I truly love the story of Beauty and the Beast. From the animated
version to this live-action remake story. Emma Watson is the perfect
choice as Belle, and everything from actors, dresses to the scenography
is spot on! I really love, that this movie tried to fix some of the
mistakes from the animated version as well. There is no doubt that this is one of the best Disney movies ever !
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Amazing film<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
An amazing film from start to finish, Emma Watson has a fantastic
voice, and her acting skills were just perfect. I was shocked at how
good Luke Evans voice was he was simply amazing acting and singing.
Entertaining and spectacular. Cant wait to get it on DVD, tempting to
go to cinema again to watch it.

. . . and totally enchants as the Belle of the BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
ball. Disney produces its best flick of the decade, highlighted by a
perfect blend of vocals channeling Joel Grey&#x27;s CABARET emcee and
visuals mimicking Busby Berkeley&#x27;s kaleidoscopic choreography in the
&#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; extravaganza. However, the most daring component of
BEAST is ripped from Today&#x27;s Headlines. Disney goes out on the limb of
risking a charge of political incorrectness by suggesting that not all
Gay Guys are Good. Tinseltown has toed this party line for decades,
with Laurel &#x26; Hardy, Abbott &#x26; Costello, Stanley &#x26; Livingston, the Lone
Ranger &#x26; Tonto, right through to Butch &#x26; Sundance. However, the Gay
Blade Gaston is clearly the Real Villain of BEAST, as even his Bi-
Belly-Hickeyed Paramour LeFou comes to realize. Not only that, but
Disney makes it Crystal Clear to even America&#x27;s toddlers that Gaston&#x27;s
pursuit of Belle to become his &#x22;beard&#x22; (or &#x22;trophy wife&#x22;) is a perfect
parallel to Don Juan Trump&#x27;s exploitation of U.S. Third Lady Melania.
About 96 minutes into this film Disney puts Trump&#x27;s most notable
Campaign Catch-Phrase (&#x22;Lock Her Up!!&#x22;) into Gaston&#x27;s mouth
(referencing Belle), and turns the gullible villagers into a crazed mob
indistinguishable from a Red State Trump Rally.

OMG this movie is so AMAZING!! Well because I&#x27;m a big fan of BATB movie
(animated one), so I have a big expectation to this movie. And the
result? Yes I am very satisfied! Well from the beginning to the ending,
I just can&#x27;t stop smiling while watching the movie. It just happened!
Of course some part made me tear my eyes. The movie is above my
expectation. I love the song, the stories, the actor/actress and
everything!! Even I have a plan to watch it again.And don&#x27;t be bothered by people who just hate it and give &#x22;1&#x22; score.
Watch it and you will know! Good job Bill Condon !
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty and the Beast: Remains faithful to the beloved classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme beloved classic Beauty
and the Beast was put into live-action directed by Bill Condon. The
story follows the 1991 original material with a few minor changes prior
not to confuse the viewers and some untold stories of their youth. An impressive take on storytelling although handled a bit slow-paced
but I like how there were little changes that will not confuse the
viewers. The movie offers a timely accurate setting and production, a
nicely done retelling of Belle and Beast&#x27;s old-fashioned romance, a
truly spectacular new set of music and score and an overall
entertaining production. Emma Watson is an ideal as Belle and Dan
Stevens is devilish handsome as the Beast and the rest of the cast were
just as amazing as the leads. The whole direction was able to give us
nostalgia, surprisingly magical and colorful musical performances and
emotional take on some important stories. The live-action remake of the
animated film is not better than the original, but it&#x27;s a fresh
retelling because we&#x27;re introduced to new characters, new songs and
some stories not told in the 1991 film. Still, it remains faithful to
the beloved family classic film. Another thing, what I like about this movie is that it&#x27;s a Disney movie
and it challenges any other movie whether Disney or not to feature
interracial and gay romance. There was nothing explicit in the romance
and it was just a short attraction.Also one thing, I think this is one the highlights of the film. I was
blown away with Dan Stevens&#x27; moving performance as the Beast as he sung
way up high on the tower the song &#x22;Evermore.&#x22; The song is important in
the part of the Beast and in general the whole movie. This is where the
spoiled, selfish and unkind prince finally learns to love and in more
elaborate way. She inspires him and will always be part of everything
he does. And that is the romance of the mean, coarse and unrefined
Beast turned into sweet, gentle and kind and an odd young woman who
likes to read and wants something more than a provincial life fall in
love with one another. I give the movie 9 out of 10. It was spectacular and I think I&#x27;m going
to see it again.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Pleasantly Surprised<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Even amidst concerns of political agendas and apprehensions about Emma
Watson&#x27;s Belle, the magic of Disney&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast prevails in
this truly enchanting fairy tale of fairy tales.Were there bits and pieces that didn&#x27;t quite feel right? Of course
there were. The animated feature film on which this is based has been
my most favorite animated film since its release in 1991. But, overall,
the essence remained, and the storybook experience was even enhanced
with lustrous visuals and the addition of three beautiful songs that I
can&#x27;t wait to download. &#x22;Days in the Sun&#x22; = so lovely :)As for Belle, I was a little disappointed with how she opened the film
in what had become the best musical opener of any animated film to
date. The Belle we instantly loved in the original Disney version was
vibrant and, although peculiar, she was comfortable in her own skin,
despite the whispers and stares in town. Emma Watson&#x27;s version seemed
gloomy and overly self-conscious. But as the film progressed, I grew to
appreciate this Belle, and, yes, I embraced her in the story.One last thing... be ready for it: the Be Our Guest number is so
spectacular, you might wonder why you&#x27;re the only one in the theater
applauding in a standing ovation at the end of it. Just sayin&#x27; ;)
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful way to capture the story!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Although the story wasn&#x27;t exactly the same as the classic cartoon, it
was still by far amazing and was a great capture of the story/remained
fairly close. I really enjoyed how they shared some tales of the
Beast&#x27;s past and really gave an insight as to how he grew up,etc. The
animation was amazing and the songs were wonderful/I enjoyed the new
ones as well! The costumes were awesome as well, will be looking for
some to wear myself! It was def worth the long wait to see the film and
was by far the best live action Disney film I have seen yet! Major
props to all of the cast and crew! Bravo!! &#x3C;3
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautifully done for a live action remake.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
A beloved classic Disney film being remade into a live action does live
up to the original movie with the lovable characters, same musical
sequences, and some beautiful visual effects. Disney&#x27;s has been doing
so well into remaking their classics into live action like the previous
films like The Jungle Book, Pete&#x27;s Dragon, Cinderella, etc. Bill Condon
direction follows the classic in every way that fans would love. The
rest comes down to criticizing the cast talent meeting the characters
expectations, the visual effects on Beasts and the characters like
Lumiere, Cogsworth, etc. I really liked the live action follow up and loved how every moment
being reenacted. Also, feel like they explore more in depth with the
Beast and Belle&#x27;s past about losing there loved ones. The plot is
amazing and beautiful being the same exact thing about the original.
The Prince (Dan Stevens) and his staff are cursed in the castle after
his actions of rejecting a beggar woman who crashes his party. She
curses the Prince turning him into a beast and his castle staff into
furniture. Then, it follows Belle (Emma Watson) who feels like an
outcast in her village for being obsessed with reading. And captures
the attention of a narcissistic Gaston (Luke Evans) who is determined
to marry her. When Belle&#x27;s father goes missing in a snowy dark castle.
She learns that her father has been imprisoned by the beast and takes
her fathers place. The castle bouteiller Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) that
is cursed into a candelabra and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) who is a clock
tries to convince the Beast to try to charm Belle and maybe she can be
the one to fall in love with him, in order to break the curse. The film does have beautiful musical sequences. Emma Watson as Belle
was a perfect choice, being a beautiful talented actress and portraying
the character really well. Hard to imagine any one else doing the role.
Dan Stevens was also great, with a performance that was delivering a
menacing voice as the beast at first, and a prince. Luke Evans and Josh
Gad were matched up well as Gaston and Lefou. Turning the animated characters in the original to a live action
version worked for the most part. I still fell in love with the
animated Cogsworth and Lumiere and found them to be funny and
entertaining. In the live action, the two being brought to a visually
realistic candelabra and antique clock was stunning but had less quirky
humor and cute characteristics the original had. Not sure if it was the
voice cast Ewan McGregor or Ian McKellen which they are very talented
actors. Or the way the characters were written. The ball dance sequence was stunning and had that magical beautiful
visuals look. The film does have plenty of gorgeous sets, visual
effects, musical sequences, and a great cast ensemble.Overall, Beauty and the Beast is a good fantasy film that lives up to
the original and fans will love. I will give the film 4 out of 5 stars.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Wonderful!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The movie was excellent! I&#x27;m not sure why people gave it under 6 stars.
The new songs in the movie were perfect, the actors were amazing, the
CGI was superb! I&#x27;ve also seen the animation and I liked it a lot but
this one is way better, seeing the characters alive as real people is
marvelous. Emma Watson was the perfect choice for the role of Belle...
Anyone who gave it 1 or 2 stars must be out of their minds!

When Disney first announced their slew of live-action remakes after the
financial success that was Maleficent, I had great doubts about them.
Maleficent was, to a point, fun, but the amount of films they planned
to make in such a short time sounded like they were not going to do the
originals justice. I found myself proved wrong with Cinderella. Alice
in the Looking Glass was a lost cause. (Pete&#x27;s Dragon, while not a
remake of an animated classic, was utterly beautiful). The Jungle Book
was nice, but highly overrated in my opinion.Then there was this. This ... THIS ... is true Disney at its finest. A
classical romantic musical adventure extravaganza filled to the brim
with a strong story, upraising laughter, marvellous tension and
pulled-straight-from-your-heart tears of both sadness and joy. Bill
Condon&#x27;s direction is a complete triumph and, if I may, the best thing
he&#x27;s ever made thus far. Alan Menken&#x27;s return as composer is
spectacular, restoring lyrics that were deleted from the original film
and adding in three new and very moving song numbers (Evermore, the
Beast&#x27;s solo, is a personal favourite). Every cast member was
masterfully chosen for their roles in both professions of acting and
singing; Emma Watson defies all expectations, Dan Stevens puts on a
magnificent and awesome Beast, Luke Evans perfectly conveys the
villain&#x27;s immoral tendencies in the form of a realistic psychopath,
Kevin Kline and Ian McKellen are as funny as ever, and Ewan McGregor
and Emma Thompson pull of their respective roles (and singing) of
Lumiere and Mrs. Potts with performances that would make Jerry Orbach
and Angela Lansbury proud.And the music... oh, the music. All the well-remembered and beloved
songs of the 1991 animated masterpiece are back, fully realised in all
of their resplendent glory and never losing any of their charm.If it&#x27;s classic Disney you love, then this is your film.

I don&#x27;t really write reviews on movies. I like reading them though. And
to be fair, I have never even written a review before. But a movie as
beautiful as Beauty And The Beast deserves to be noticed. So before you
read, go ahead. Tell me I&#x27;m exaggerating. Because, honestly I don&#x27;t
really care if you thought the movie was great or just utter rubbish.
The movie was indeed great and made me want to watch it again for the
FOURTH time.Okay, on to my discussion:First of all, I am just one of those casual moviegoers who like to
watch movies that are always popping up in the Internet of how great it
is. So one day, I was just surfing the web and I found something rather
exciting. Disney was making a live-adaptation of their beloved animated
classic, Beauty And The Beast. And I felt like a kid again. Beauty And
The Beast was one of my favorite Disney movies of all time and will
always have a special place in my heart. After a few months, they had
released a trailer that blew up over the Internet. It looked stunning
and magical. Everyone was talking about it. Then it started popping up on Google advertisements. Then on
television. Even starring on network commercials in my country. And
there was a sudden urge to go into the theater and watch it right then
and there. And so I did. When I got there, all seats were taken on
THREE different theaters. Was it really that hyped? I felt
disappointed. So I thought that I&#x27;ll go ahead and wait for it next week
(because it obviously would go for a second week), to empty the space.
The next week I go into the theater yet again... And it was still FULL.
Whaaaat?! It&#x27;s already been a week, yet there&#x27;s still so much
moviegoers. Luckily, I remembered to reserve online in case this would
happen. ;)I got inside and went through the boring advertisements and got out
smiling.Beauty And The Beast is enchanting, entertaining and magical in its own
way. And I tell you, DON&#x27;T believe the negative reviewers. They just
thought that it sucked because it didn&#x27;t match the original. Maybe it
didn&#x27;t exceed their favor for the original. But from a blind-audience&#x27;s
perspective of both movies, they did a really great job of bringing the
movie to life. There wasn&#x27;t a single set that seemed extraordinary. All
were immersing in its set up. In a small provincial town and its
townspeople wearing those goofy headdresses that made it look like it
was actual real. The musical numbers were great and the choreography
was perfect. With my favorite being &#x22;Be Our Guest.&#x22; The cast was great
and the acting was on point. Not to mention Dan and Emma&#x27;s roles as
quirky but pretty Belle and the horrifying Beast as they find their
love for each other despite their differences. I literally was jumping
on my seat smiling whenever they both had a scene together. Oh! And the
ending made me CRY like a bitch. Which I didn&#x27;t even feel when I
watched the original. I loved Gaston and Le Fou&#x27;s funny attitude. Le
Fou and Lumiere has got to be my favorites! The only problem was the clear auto-tuning which, to be honest, wasn&#x27;t
really much of a bother to me and I wish that the movie could have been
a little bit longer just to add in some extra scenes of Belle and the
Beast. :3What more is there not to love?!New songs, beautiful sets, stunning costumes, romance, and EMMA WATSON!
And what do you get? Well, just might be the best movie ever in 2017
(As of now, that is).Over all 9.5/10. &#x1F600;P.S. Not looking forward for The Little Mermaid :P
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Visually Stunning<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The whole film is amazing to watch, the costumes and the scenography
are stunning! Dan Stevens&#x27; Beast is marvelous and him and Emma have
great chemistry. It is indeed a remake of the classic but there are
some new scene that add that &#x22;Je ne sais quoi&#x22; that makes this film
utterly amazing. I loved it, laughed and cried with it. Go and watch it
in theatres, it&#x27;s worth it!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A charming new take on a beloved classic.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Well, most of the user reviews that I&#x27;ve seen on here for this film are
mixed-to-negative so I decided to give it a positive review for a
change of pace.Let me be clear; this isn&#x27;t going to replace the original film. The
original &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; is still very much the masterpiece that
made it the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture.
Clearly, there were a lot of expectations towards this new film because
of that prestigious pedigree. And, clearly, it was one of the riskiest
ventures of Disney&#x27;s recent run of live-action remakes. And because
this film is probably the closest to its original out of all the Disney
remakes so far, the term &#x27;unnecessary&#x27; is being thrown around a lot.
Maybe it is, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me in the slightest.Yes, this film has almost the exact same plot as its predecessor, but
at the same time, there are some minor touches here and there that at
least help it to differentiate itself from the original. At the very
least, it&#x27;s not a 100% carbon copy of what we saw before. Plus, the
film is undeniably well-made with gorgeous visuals and an equally
gorgeous production design. The classic songs are handled excellently
in live-action, the new songs are great additions, and the film&#x27;s
impressively stacked ensemble cast is fantastic.In short, I know that there are people out there who aren&#x27;t too big on
the remakes. That&#x27;s fine; no one&#x27;s forcing you to watch them. But, at
the same time, these new films are not negatively impacting their
original sources to the high levels that those who oppose them claim
they are. At worst, they&#x27;d just end up being a mediocre remake that
just makes their original counterpart even better by comparison. And
yet, that hasn&#x27;t been the case with most of the recent Disney remakes.
They don&#x27;t replace their original sources; they just serve as a nice
little complement to them. This new take on &#x27;Beauty and the Beast&#x27; is
no exception. So, with that in mind, ignore all the negativity
surrounding this film (particularly the completely overblown backlash
towards a new aspect of the film that is so subtle, you probably
wouldn&#x27;t have noticed it if everyone hadn&#x27;t made such a big deal about
it) and just enjoy a heartwarming new take on one of Disney&#x27;s most
beloved stories.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Perfect through and through<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I absolutely loved it! Starting from the perfect casting to the songs
(old and new).Emma Watson was perfect for the part of Belle, I couldn&#x27;t imagine
anyone else doing the part justice. She brought a grace to Belle&#x27;s
movements and character that reminded me of old Hollywood (Julie
Andrews, Audrey Hepburn). Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou
were pure perfection as well. I also found that Dan Stevens brought a
lot of humanity and humor to the Beast and by the end of the movie I
could see why she fell in love with him. I always found the cartoon was
a bit rushed in this respect. It felt like they met and the next day
they confessed their love and The End. The movie fixed this as well as
several other plot holes that the original cartoon had in my opinion.
The movie, probably benefiting from being longer than the cartoon, had
a much better pace and thus could flesh out the characters more fully. During &#x22;Be our guest&#x22; I realized that I was smiling from ear to ear and
I did not find it overstuffed at all. Others mentioned that the new
songs were not catchy like the old ones. I actually left the cinema
humming Days in the sun and Evermore. I got the soundtrack and the
second I got home and these two songs are practically on a loop since
then.The only thing I did not like was one of the 3D effects. I saw the
movie twice in IMAX 3D and the time they pan up to ceiling of Belle&#x27;s
bedroom with all the gold leaves, that scene was completely blurry and
I was forced to look away. Other than that the 3D effects were better
than expected. It was probably the first time during a 3D movie where I
flinched when seeing something coming towards me. Marvel movies never
managed to get me :)I also loved the changes they made to Belle&#x27;s costumes. The small
touches they added here and there were very notable and just perfect.All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone and I would even pay
to watch it for a 3rd, 4th, 5th time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Decide for yourself<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I can&#x27;t help but wonder if there are ulterior motives behind some of
the negative reviews here. I&#x27;m not saying that everybody will love it
but I question whether many of the over the top negative reviewers
actually saw the movie.The characters were everything I imagined they would be brought to
life. Luke Evans was particularly excellent as Gaston. The sets, the
costumes, the music....it all fit perfectly. We didn&#x27;t go to this movie expecting deep character development,
intense dialogue and/or state of the art CGI effects. We had our
imaginations and this movie to inspire them. Imagination has no
threshold. It&#x27;s too bad so few people have one or use theirs anymore.Don&#x27;t panic about the so called gay scene. If you look down for a
second or blink, you will likely miss it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Perfect! Wonderful film!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This film was spot on. Practically perfect in every way. I loved it
entirely. The casting is spot on. I don&#x27;t think anyone did a bad Job.Emma Watson was spot on. Her singing is perfect and no, it is NOT
auto-tuned. She said so herself. She said many people were betting her
singing was auto-tuned, well, it wasn&#x27;t. It was all her. People need to
leave her performance alone. She was perfect in every way. Nothing
wrong with her. She&#x27;s actually my favorite Belle having seen on screen.
More so than Paige O&#x27;Hara.I only had three very minor problems.#1: I missed the Broadway songs. I feel they should have included them
into the film. Especially Human Again and If I Can&#x27;t Love Her.#2: I hated they changed the Feather Duster and Wardrobe&#x27;s names. I
prefer the names Babette and Madame De La Grande Bouche.#3: I feel they rushed the story a bit. It was pretty speedy.But other than that, it&#x27;s beautiful. I loved what they did with Lefou.
Lumiere was my favorite of the males (No wonder as he is my dream role
for the musical and has always been my favorite character). Belle was
my favorite of the female.If people love the classic film, they will love this one. Maaaaaybe not
more, and maaaaaaybe not as much. But you will definitely adore it.Emma Watson has definitely come far since playing Hermione in Harry
Potter. She is a spot on Belle. Pure perfect. And people need to stop
bashing her. Her singing is perfect.

I had read so many bad reviews of this film that it almost put me off
going to see it. I am so glad I did go. This is a dazzling, vibrant
musical Spectacular with all the characters from the original movie
brought wonderfully to life. But I thought it was better than the
original film as it allowed me to see even more into Belle and the

<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A faithful yet fresh adaptation, of the beloved animated classic.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast is a live action adaptation of the 1991 Disney
animated film of the same name. Belle(Emma Watson) decides to take her
father&#x27;s place &#x26; be held captive by a man who has been cursed to remain
a beast, until he finds true love. Soon, Belle realizes that Beast(Dan
Stevens) is not as monstrous as she thinks he is. Beauty and the Beast is a mind blowing movie. Director Bill Condon &#x26;
script writers Stephen Chbosky &#x26; Evan Spiliotopoulos have remained
faithful to the animated Beauty and the Beast(1991), while adding many
new &#x26; refreshing aspects to the story. I love the fact that Belle is
given a detailed backstory in this adaptation. Also, one or two things
that didn&#x27;t make sense in the animated film, have been rectified in the
live action movie. This film is a feast for the eyes. All the songs
performed by the actors themselves, are colorful, entertaining &#x26;
visually appealing. The whole movie, especially the song &#x27;Be Our Guest&#x27;
&#x26; the ballroom dance scene will evoke a sense of nostalgia for fans of
the animated original. The action set pieces are engaging. The entire
film becomes an even better experience because of the 3D. There are so
many scenes where objects in the movie, fly right at your face. The
visual effects are excellent. The songs composed by Alan Menken are
unforgettable. All the actors have sung beautifully. The production
design by Sarah Greenwood is amazing. Greenwood has recreated all the
beautiful locations from Beauty and the Beast(1991). The cast portray
their characters, effortlessly. Emma Watson is the star of the show, as
Belle. Watson delivers a spectacular performance &#x26; makes the famous &#x26;
beloved character of Belle, her own. Dan Stevens is wonderful as Beast.
Stevens&#x27; motion captured performance is commendable, considering he had
to walk on stilts during his performance, to appear much taller as
Beast. Emma Watson &#x26; Dan Stevens share this warm &#x26; electrifying
chemistry, in all their scenes together. Luke Evans is outstanding as
Gaston. Josh Gad is brilliant as LeFou. Kevin Kline is great as
Maurice. Hattie Morahan is impressive as Agathe/Enchantress. Ewan
McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Nathan Mack, Audra McDonald,
Stanley Tucci &#x26; Gugu Mbatha-Raw are superb as Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs.
Potts, Chip, Madame Garderobe, Maestro Cadenza &#x26; Plumette,
respectively. Beauty and the Beast is a must watch for the entire
family. Go, have a whale of a time!

Just saw it this afternoon with my mom and sister, and it was
absolutely magical!! Very beautiful. Emma Watson was absolutely perfect
for Belle. And her singing voice was amazing!! Dan Stevens is the
Beast/ Prince and just perfect. Emma Thompson was perfect Mrs. Potts
and I believe Angela Lansbury would definitely approve of Emma&#x27;s turn
at singing Beauty and the Beast&#x27;. Ewan McGregor was exquisite as
Luminere. Ian McKellan was very timely as Cogsworth, perfect. Luke
Evans was perfectly evil as Gaston And Josh Gads was perfect goofy as
LeFou Kevin Kline was brilliant as Maurice Stanley Tucci was great as
the Mistro And the cast was just perfectly magical. And I loved Agatha the enchantress. She was very mysterious and I loved
how Maurice knew her. My favorite part of the movie was at the end when Belle asked the
Prince how he felt about growing a beard and he playfully growled, like
a Beast, at her.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Visually beautiful, very engaging, excellent overall.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Of course we all know the plot, as the story has been around forever.
This movie follows the story faithfully for the most part, but adds
music, dancing, wonderful costumes, and some modern plot elements that
to some may seem unusual, but are totally in keeping with reality in
today&#x27;s world. &#x22;Reality&#x22; seems an out of place word here where teacups
and candelabra sing and dance, but the human (and beast) characters are
well rounded and believable. Belle is strong without being overdone,
Gaston is evil and leads others to be so also, but that, too, is an
expression of today&#x27;s world. The plot is as it always was and doesn&#x27;t
need explaining since we all pretty much know it already. A happy
ending too, and that&#x27;s as it should be. All in all an excellent movie
for both adults and kids (7 or 8 years and up). No situations that
would require embarrassing explanations, despite ridiculous claims by
people who claim an &#x22;agenda&#x22;. That&#x27;s just silly. Go see it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A definite score of 10, 3D is a must!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I found many of the top reviews too cruel on their critics when the
film was just released on its first day. Having read them before seeing
the film with my own eyes, I was truly nervous and worried that it will
be a disappointment, yet despite all that I still went and it turned
out to be most fulfilling and satisfying. Now I am back from the cinema
giving it a 10, well it is not perfect, but it deserve a little
compliment and you can not deny some of the beautiful replicate on the
old scenes which clearly shows the efforts that the team has put in,
and I am not very picky when it comes to actors, I found them singing
quite well too considering they are not professionals. During the 2 and
half hours. I could not help but held a big smile on my face for over
half of the time, it is like a dream come true, with all the most
lovely songs and scenes and childhood memories. I was less than 10
years old when I first saw the cartoon version and now at age of 30, I
could be in the cinema with my husband, holding his hand and watch it
together, it was such a wonderful moment, I want to give a big THANKS
to Disney for making all these happen, thank you for all your stories
and songs that makes the world with more love and brightness. I hope
when I have children they will love your work as much as I do.Finally I strongly recommend the 3D version, it brings everything more
alive and fancy and exhilarating!

Disney has done it again. We all know the story. It&#x27;s a &#x22;tale as old as
time&#x22;. We all know the formula by now. Disney is taking their classic
movies and re-making, re-imagining, recreating them (whatever you want
to call it) as live-action movies. In 2010, Tim Burton and Disney
brought the live-action version of Alice in Wonderland with Johnny Depp
to the big screen. Maleficent followed in 2014 starring Angelina Jolie
re-telling the story of Sleeping Beauty. Next was Cinderella in 2015
and 2016 gave us Pete&#x27;s Dragon and The Jungle Book. Now, Emma Watson
reprises the role of Belle in Beauty and the Beast. Disney&#x27;s original
groundbreaking animated masterpiece was released in November 1991. It
was nominated for Best Picture of the Year, the first of only 3
animated movies to ever be nominated for Best Picture.The preview for Beauty and the Beast looked breathtakingly beautiful.
There is so much to show in so little time, so they don&#x27;t really waste
any of it trying to summarize the plot like they do in most previews,
assuming you already know the story. Instead, you are given little
gems. A glimpse of the Beast that looks like Disney&#x27;s original
animation come to life. Brief shots of our favorite characters: Chip,
Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson), Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) and Lumiere (Ewan
McGregor). Emma Watson as Belle, who may not be the obvious choice, but
looked in the preview to pull off the role quite well, and she does a
fantastic job. The CGI that looked like it would hold its own against
Disney&#x27;s latest reinvention of The Jungle Book that just won an Oscar
for Best Visual Effects. And some of the familiar music that made the
first so special.I had extremely high expectations for Beauty and the Beast, but there
were a few things that I felt would have to be nailed for this to be
perfect. Belle. As I just said, Watson doesn&#x27;t immediately stand out as
the obvious choice for the role. She looked great in the preview, but I
wondered if she could hold it with the intelligence, grace, bravery,
strength and singing required to match her predecessor&#x27;s performance.
She did. In fact, after seeing her performance and hearing her voice
mastering so many iconic songs, I don&#x27;t know that I could imagine
anyone else in the role.I also felt that the animation needed to be flawless. This film had two
previous movies to live up to: the original animated version from 1991
that was nominated for Best Picture and the 2016 Jungle Book. Many of
the critiques I&#x27;ve read about Beauty and the Beast criticized the CGI,
specifically the Beast. They say his eyes are off and the characters
are flat. I disagree and wonder if they didn&#x27;t understand the
difference in story-telling between Jungle Book and Beauty and the
Beast. Jungle Book was supposed to be much more realistic, aside from
talking animals. It wasn&#x27;t a fantasy world, it wasn&#x27;t a dream, it was a
man-child in the jungle with real animals. Beauty and the Beast is
fantasy, a place of Belle&#x27;s dreams and others&#x27; nightmares. A Prince
turned into a hideous beast. Servants turned into a candlestick, a
clock, a dresser, a teapot and cup. Of course the animation is going to
look different. Now, that being said, there were a couple moments with
Beast walking that were slightly less perfect than his animation for
the rest of the movie. However, the human characters&#x27; interactions with
the animated ones were seamless.The music. Jungle Book didn&#x27;t hold back with their musical numbers and
I hoped that Beast wouldn&#x27;t either. They didn&#x27;t. In fact, we were
introduced to a few new songs written just for this live-action version
of the classic. We get to see the history of the Prince and why he
became such a selfish man. We also got to see what happened to Belle&#x27;s
mother and what drove her father from Paris when she was just a baby.
Though they didn&#x27;t have the same catchy lyrics that will have kids and
adults singing for 16 years to come, they fit right in with the story
and were welcomed additions to the film.And finally, the ballroom scene. The sweeping shot of the chandelier in
the grand ballroom with Belle in her yellow dress and Beast in his blue
suit was nothing short of iconic and groundbreaking in the original
animation. It&#x27;s a lot to live up to. They went a slightly different
route with the ballroom scene. Instead of one central chandelier, they
had several in the room and the sweeping shot around the room revealed
instruments on the wall helping to orchestrate their dance. My only
criticism of that scene was that the original shone so bright and
golden and this version, although beautiful, was a little muted.Beauty and the Beast had a lot to live up to, and the preview made it
look like they were up to the task. So I gave it a very enthusiastic
and hopeful 4.5 Star Prediction. After watching the movie, I believe
they were very successful in paying tribute to the original while
making decisions to set their live action version apart and modern-ish
for 2017. I enjoyed it completely and thought it nearly perfect except
for my few minor criticisms. So I&#x27;m sticking with my 4.5 Star rating.

I was a child when Disney 1st released the same movie as a cartoon and
delighted by watching this with romance, humor and some emotional
scenes with excellent music. This changed from the original a bit
though didn&#x27;t harm the story what we knew. An excellent effort from
Disney again and hope they will thrill us producing more. I&#x27;ve read
some critics from some people above and saw some negative comments. But
trust me this is a movie you could watch with your children and there
you have to imagine like a child. This is surely a movie worth
watching. I have to straightly mentioned this. I&#x27;ve little frustrated
by seeing some horrible reviews from some people here. But I was
enjoyed it and all the houseful crowd there still after a lot of time
releasing the movie proves me what I think was correct...Truly a
masterpiece.

Went to see this movie last night and dragged my husband along for
company as all my movie &#x27;buddies&#x27; had already been to see it. I fully
expected him to be nodding off early into the film, but to my surprise
he actually enjoyed it. As for me - I loved it. It has been a long time
since I&#x27;ve been to see a good musical (La La Land doesn&#x27;t fall into
this category for me...dismal film); however, for 2+ hours I was able
to completely lose myself in this movie and wasn&#x27;t bored for one
minute. The one thing I can&#x27;t understand is the criticism that Emma
Watson has been receiving from lots of reviewers as I thought she was
the perfect Belle. Some people even referred to her as being
&#x27;unemotional&#x27; and too &#x27;cold&#x27;. For me; however, Emma captured Belle
exquisitely, with just the right mix of angst, vulnerability, strength,
longing - and in the end, love. She is a natural beauty without the
typical Hollywood glamour - a refreshing change if you ask me. As for
Luke Evans - he most definitely nailed it as Gaston!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Just because I loved the animated film doesn&#x27;t mean I have to bash this one<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
OK, I&#x27;m a big fan of the 1991 classic so I had little or no
expectations at all about this live action film but I ended up taking
my daughter to the theater anyway, and here&#x27;s the flash: I don&#x27;t care
about people trolling lately on reviews just because there&#x27;s no longer
a forum on IMDb, so in my opinion this movie was spectacular.I just don&#x27;t understand some of the haters here; if the story would
have distanced too much from the original plot there would be a riot,
but now that a true remake has taken place, there are complaints as
well. Of course the Beast would look weird; it&#x27;s not real and it&#x27;s
supposed to look strange in the first place! If producers would have
chosen a Halloween costume instead, would some people have been pleased
then? As for the music, it was the right decision to use the original
songs along with new ones.One thing I liked about this version was character development,
something that was amiss from the 1991 film. Maurice, in example, is
200% more memorable in this rendition, and the newfound feelings
between the main characters are not as abrupt as in the first one; also
I enjoyed both Belle and Beast&#x27;s backstories.The only scene that I quite didn&#x27;t like was the Beast final
transformation; I felt it was kind of rushed after such a steady pace
throughout the movie.I liked all the acting in general; almost no one has commented about
Kevin Kline&#x27;s performance which gave a major enhancement to Maurice&#x27;s
character; Luke Evans as Gaston was remarkable as well... and finally,
there&#x27;s no big deal about Josh Gad&#x27;s gay character, it was nothing
different from other films, except that this is a family-oriented
Disney movie and Disney felt they needed to be politically correct
about it... overall a magnificent film.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>This is a Disney film for children<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It really irks me when adults critique a children&#x27;s movie. So from my 7
year old granddaughter &#x22; I loved it. I got scared but I can&#x27;t wait for
the DVD. And I love Emma Watson! &#x22; As a grandmother I also thoroughly
enjoyed it. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called Disney. I think they did a great
job.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>The way a reboot/live action should be made<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First, one thing must be clear, this movie is intended for children
first, then their parents.With that mentality, it becomes clear that the movie is almost perfect,
and it beings back some elements missing from Disney more recent
releases.The story is redone almost step by step from the original animated
movie, something you gotta give credit for, since the original had
great pace and good story line, the little out of the plot incursions
are so minor that they don&#x27;t spoil the narration.The production is the highest point, every single detail was done to be
really close to the animated material, to the point where Belle&#x27;s
yellow dress had to receive gold decals by means of animation.There are no plot twists, which made me enjoy the movie even more.The gold point here is that Disney did what no one expected, a perfect
production for the already perfect history. Every reboot, re film, Live
action and such must have this movie as base from now on.Great to watch with the kids.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>One word - Enchanting<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I loved the animated version and this version did not disappoint. From
start to finish I was completely sucked in! Emma Watson was a perfect
cast for Belle and her voice was amazing.All the characters were well matched, i love the fact they kept to the
original - as there was nothing wrong with that! The whole thing was Enchanting and Magical - highly recommend going to
see it and being part of that magic!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Awesome remake with Disney magic and spellbinding visuals. Don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney&#x27;s live-action remake of the much loved classic animated film
Beauty and the Beast lives up to the hype, and is just as good as, or
possibly even better than the animated version. The story is the same,
with enough new things in it to add something fresh. Most of the songs
from the animated version are in the film, and sound quite similar to
those in the animated version. All this makes viewers nostalgic for the
old film. The acting is what one would expect from such a huge cast.
Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou are especially spectacular,
as they add humor to their already well developed characters. As I
already mentioned, the songs and the music are great, and live up to
Disney standards. The cinematography is also great, with long sweeping
shots during the musical sequences. The shots of the setting and of the
castle are also amazing. What really impressed me about this movie
though is the costumes, the sets, the castle, and the general look of
the film. Wow wow wow applause clap clap clap!!! No description of mine
can do justice to the amazing design and the spectacular use of CGI. I
was worried about what the beast and the objects in the castle might
look like in a live-action movie, but Disney did a very good job of not
just making it work, but making it amazing. Another thing about this
version of Beauty and the Beast that I loved was that there&#x27;s a
homosexual character! In a Disney princess movie with a lot of clich&#xE9;s
in it, it&#x27;s awesome to see some diversity. Disney&#x27;s remake of Beauty and the Beast will make fans of the animated
classic nostalgic. It will delight a new generation of children. I
wouldn&#x27;t recommend bringing really young children to see it though, as
there is some violence and things that may spoil your child&#x27;s
innocence. The movie is very enjoyable for teens and adults as well.
However, if you don&#x27;t like the animated classic, you will not enjoy
this movie. If you don&#x27;t like classic fairy tales featuring princes and
castles, don&#x27;t see this movie. If you hate musicals, don&#x27;t see this
movie. See this movie for the Disney charm, the nostalgia for the
animated version, the music, and the amazing visuals. I would highly
recommend seeing Beauty and the Beast in the cinema, possibly in 3D.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>musical magic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
For starters, one can never go in, expecting the level of perfection
the original had. In 1991 we were given heaven in the shape of some of
the most magical lyrics written&#x200B; anywhere. The animation wasn&#x27;t
spectacular, but the film was special and had plenty of soul. It was a
great picture. The newest entry has new songs, which are decent but
nowhere near as spectacular as the original score. However, the new
entry does really well in most instances.The new cast shines providing much of the reality and magic to the
living furniture. They, after all, are human. Emma Thompson is strong
and sweet. The rest of the cast does a decent job. And there is Belle
who in spite of not being a professional singer manages to handle the
songs nicely. No superb singing, but she&#x27;s not a singer, she&#x27;s
alternate misfit. Unlike recent musicals, this is one is touching and
fill of memorable and deep interpretations. There&#x27;s plenty to him along
even in the new songs.I like what they added to the story. Tiny bits that give you some
insight about many of the main characters. The prince is not just a
beast, but a product of his upbringing. Belle is more complicated and
with much going on in her heart and mind.The musical adaptation is fantastic. The village opening number will
leave breathless and the people behind the art direction, sets, and
costumes deserve the highest praise. Gowns look glorious and the sets
made me believe we were in the middle of an opulent setting. Great job.Simply, adaptation great films is problematic from the start, yet no
misfires here. Condom tops his precious musical entries and manages to
keep that soul intact, making us believe in an intelligent romance.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Could Emma Watson be more beautiful???  &#x3C;3<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I am a guy and admit I only saw this movie because I think Emma Watson
is the cutest and most beautiful thing and she looked more beautiful in
this movie than any movie I have seen her to date or ever-after all her
name is Belle-meaning beautiful in French-and I would have been
disappointed if any actress played Belle other than Emma; therefore,
Emma playing Belle seemed felicitous. I could be wrong, but I think
this is her first movie she has been in where she is really considered
the main character.I am not going to give anything away since I really cannot. I vaguely
remember the original 1991 movie that I saw decades ago; but from what
I do, the movie does a pretty good job of emulating the original 1991
animated version, while adding its own flair.A few people I have seen on TV this morning criticized Emma Watson&#x27;s
singing in the movie, but I thought she sounded perfect-then again,
maybe I am biased because I have adored her since the Harry Potter
Films and have seen all her other movies since. I thought all of the parts were played perfectly and the film was an
overall joy to watch, and didn&#x27;t feel silly watching this on opening
day as a grown man surrounded by mostly very little kids with their
parents. I think most of the parents who brought their children
probably wanted to see it more than their children.If any event, I think this movie will go down in history, despite the
critics and look forward to getting this on DVD when it comes out. I
was a little confused about the part where they flashback about Belle&#x27;s
mother and Belle as a baby and what really happened. Perhaps, it was
because I was startled by Emma&#x27;s beauty. I also did not understand the
magical powers of the woman who released Belle&#x27;s father, as that is
never clearly explained and maybe wasn&#x27;t supposed to be.The film was great. Emma was beautiful as Belle. Perfect adaptation.
Emma was beautiful, especially in those dresses. The film was the
perfect length. Emma was even stunning in the very beginning before she
wore those dresses in the village-maybe even more beautiful than in the
dresses, as she has the most beautiful face. This is a great movie for
the whole family, especially if you have kids and gives off a warm
feeling and nostalgic feeling of when you saw the original as a kid or
adult.By the way did I happen to mention how unbelievably beautiful and cute
Emma Watson was in the movie? 10/10. Three thumbs way up!!!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>My life will never be the same<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie is easily the best film in 20 years. The set design is
beautiful, the music is beautiful, the love story between Belle and The
Beast is beautiful. The cast is extremely talented and every
performance in this film deserves praise. Emma Watson was born for this
role, never have I ever seen someone so perfect for a role they played.
Dan Stevens portrays so much emotion through The Beast even under the
cgi. Ewan McGregor&#x27;s voice acting was very impressive, as he even sang
the entire &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; with an accent he doesn&#x27;t have. And Luke
Evans did all too well of a job making you hate Gaston. Every single
cast member had surprisingly really good singing voices, making this
the best musical I have ever seen. It is far better than last year&#x27;s La
La Land, which Watson turned down the lead role in for this film. Which
I am very fortunate for, as her performance in itself could have made
this movie amazing even if the rest of the cast wasn&#x27;t. Her singing of
&#x22;Belle&#x22; and Dan Steven&#x27;s singing of &#x22;Evermore&#x22; were tear-invoking. The
plot was so masterfully written, even including some perfect original
scenes and songs. This film should easily be an award contender, and I
look forward to seeing it many more times
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A step up from previous Disney&#x27;s animation adaptation movies<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Went to the theater to watch this movie three times and I have zero
regrets. The movie meets my expectation and certainly worth the wait. I
love everything about this movie; the casting, almost seamless CGI
effect, the brand new songs, and the plot which kind of completing the
plot holes in the original one.It is a dream come true to watch Emma Watson plays Belle. Emma is
breathtakingly beautiful in it and the movie really exploit her singing
(quite good for beginner), acting and dancing skills. I couldn&#x27;t be
more happier that they cast Emma as Belle. Both Emma and Belle are
truly a good role model for young girls. Needless to say Belle is my
all time favorite Disney princess so I&#x27;m probably heavily bias.And to The Beast of it all, Dan plays Adam so fiercely. He shares about
how complicated it was for him to transform into The Beast and I&#x27;m
seriously amazed how this handsome and charming guy could transform
into a monster. Hats off special effect team!Josh as Lefou and Luke as Gaston are perfect for their respective
roles. I can&#x27;t imagine another actors playing their role other than
them. Also I like this version of Lefou because he&#x27;s less stupid and
not a blind follower of Gaston (like in the animated version) which is
pretty good.If you love the original, love fairy tales, love musical or just love
the actors, I&#x27;m damn sure you would enjoy the movie. See, I wouldn&#x27;t
dedicate one post for it if it is not that good.. So, seriously, this
is the best animation adaptation movie by far. Go watch it &#x2764;
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Not one to look back<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Well I absolutely loved this movie. Couldn&#x27;t give a care that an
animated 1991 version was much better!? Animated - not my thing - and
truly why would you even make a comparison between a cartoon and a CGI,
human acted movie, nonsensical to me. I am far from a Disney fan as all
the singing generally drives me crazy but in this case I just sat back
and enjoyed it all. I took my 8 year old who enjoyed it immensely. She
found the Beast scary, hid her face a few times from the action and
swooned over the love story. So in frankness I&#x27;m unsure what all the
negativity from the adults is all about - oh wait... Yep it&#x27;s a movie
for kids. All very simple, very pure and true to form but shockingly
without the animation. I think you could see that was the case from the
previews and the posters and the casting. But well, it appears people
went hoping Disney would re-write an animated movie and recreate the
whole premise to just appease grownups. Had they done that of course -
the reviews would be even worse I can guarantee it. If you loved the
original story and enjoyed the characters and found the love story and
the message of being bigger and better at being a human being .. then
you&#x27;ll love this movie too. It&#x27;s very beautiful, Emma was fine, Dan was
fine ... every one was fine and it was 2 hours of pure entertainment.
All I hope for in a movie. I think Disney out did themselves and I
HIGHLY recommend it as a modern day reprisal of a much loved animated
film without trying to recreate perfection.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Excellent Live Action Of Disney&#x27;s Beauty &#x26; The Beast!!!!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The original animated version that was released in 1991 was excellent,
and so was this. Granted, there were a few things from the original
which they changed or did not include in this version (Gaston already
having the wedding ceremony &#x26; reception, for example), but, it was
still just as fun as the original, nonetheless.Another change, though a good one, was that they showed the enchantress
was still very much involved in the lives of everyone in the film,
albeit, in a very subtle way.Emma Watson looks exactly like the animated version of Belle, and she
had the acting to match. Dan Stevens who plays the Beast/Prince is
equally good. Actually, all the actors and actresses were very good in
this film.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney gets it right with a tiny little twist that got extreme conservatives in a twist.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
There are plenty of changes in the movie version of the Broadway
version of the hit animated classic, the first animated film to be
nominated for an Oscar. It&#x27;s a colorful blend of live action and
computer generated effects where everything seems alive as opposed to
painted. Belle is played by the attractive, if not typical a Hollywood
beauty (Emma Watson), certainly no pushover for the obnoxious Gaston
(Luke Evans). When her eccentric father (Kevin Kline) ends up under the
clutches of beast Dan Stevens, Belle offers herself in place of him.
His beastliness must vanish, and that falls to Belle to guide him to
change, not because he simply has to in order to reverse a curse, but
because he wants to out of love for a good woman.This jumps off the screen from the start, far less pretentious and over
the top as similar fantasy tales that dominate the screen a bit too
much. Each character is believable, and the modern twist concerning
Josh Gad&#x27;s LeFou, subtle in its insinuations, but scandalous because of
press headlines drawing both praises and boo&#x27;s. While some of the new
songs for Broadway have been dropped in favor of new songs (giving new
songs Oscar potential), all the favorites of the original movie are
there, staged brilliantly as if they were flying off the stage of the
Palace or the Ambassador, its Broadway homes.The household staff, turned into household items which reflect their
personality, are a highlight with a delightfully warm Emma Thompson as
Mrs. Potts, Ewan MacGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth and
Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe. &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; is lusciously
staged, and I wiped my eyes quite a bit, both in the beauty and the
beast&#x27;s twin soliloquies and the title song. While I loved and missed
the beast&#x27;s song from the Broadway version cut from the show, the
replacement is equally as moving. This should create an instant classic
that I hope gets past the controversy and becomes a major smash.

<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Standing Ovation<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Within ten minutes of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; 2017. I wanted to rise
from my seat and applaud. Within twenty minutes I had laughed, gasped,
and been wowed. I can&#x27;t say &#x22;go see it.&#x22; You will see it. It&#x27;s going to
be a classic. I saw a ten a.m. matin&#xE9;e, thinking that I&#x27;d avoid the crowds. No way.
The theater was full. Some little girls were dressed in fairy tale
gowns. In spite of the film&#x27;s length, I didn&#x27;t see anyone bail &#x96; no one
left the theater and never returned. When the film ended, the audience
broke out in applause. I love watching lots of money and talent explode on every inch of my
visual field. &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; slathers on the money *and* the
TLC. Someone took the time to paint roses on the lintels of a cottage,
and to costume Belle in bloomers so she can ride a horse, and to
wrinkle the noses of the CGI wolves when they growl. &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; feels very much like a fairy tale. It has the
plot conventions and morality of a fairy tale. The wolves menace when
menacing wolves are needed to move the plot along, and they are nowhere
to be seen when Belle needs to ride through that forest without being
interrupted. This is how fairy tales work. They have their own logic. A
peasant crone entering a rich man&#x27;s house, begging for alms and being
refused &#x96; that is the classic spark of a witch frenzy, or a curse. Watching Emma Watson delighted me just as watching Julie Andrews in
films like &#x22;Mary Poppins&#x22; and &#x22;Sound of Music&#x22; once did. Watson is an
intelligent, dignified, decent human being and that comes across in her
every move. She&#x27;s never the dumb blonde, never the shrinking violet or
damsel in distress, never the flirtatious coquette who has nothing to
recommend her but her curves. She inhabits the role of a smart,
inquisitive, integral human being. Twinkly-eyed old pro Kevin Kline is a favorite. Ewan Macgregor somehow
manages to turn on the charm even as he is nothing more than a CGI
candlestick. Emma Thompson imbues a &#x22;there, there now&#x22; maternal
instinct into a Cockney teapot, Stanley Tucci, Audra MacDonald, and Ian
McKellan are more jewels in the cast. You can practically smell the testosterone coming off of Luke Evans as
Gaston. He&#x27;s both funny and menacing, just handsome enough and just
oily enough. The few complaints I have with this film I had with the animated
version as well. I wish there were more time spent building a
relationship between The Beast and Belle, and less time spent on chase
and fight scenes, but I recognize that this is primarily a film for
children and kids don&#x27;t want to watch the kind of subtle interaction
and tender moments that Jean Cocteau depicted in his live action,
adult-oriented 1946 &#x22;La Belle et la Bete.&#x22; I do think that Gaston is an anti-male character. Gaston is not just a
bad guy. He&#x27;s an indictment of traditional masculinity. But that&#x27;s a
whole &#x27;nother essay. I do wish we had had more time with The Beast generally. Dan Stevens is
a very good looking man. I wanted more of him, both before and after
transformation, and more of The Beast. But you can&#x27;t have everything.
For that, there&#x27;s fan-fiction, and there&#x27;s a lot of it on the web. About the protests. LeFou casts yearning glances in Gaston&#x27;s direction,
and there is a very brief shot of him dancing with another male
character. And &#x85; that&#x27;s it. *All* the movie does is remind us that
there are gay people among our friends, neighbors, and fairy tale
characters. There is nothing graphic or inappropriate for children. In
fact, most children won&#x27;t even notice LeFou&#x27;s orientation. I&#x27;m not even
sure I would have, had I not read articles about protests before going
to see the film. Too many Christians are willing financially to support violent,
misogynist, and graphic films, TV shows and video games. If you liked
the violent movie &#x22;Logan,&#x22; if you voted for a man who speaks about
grabbing &#x96; ahem &#x96; if you laugh at contemptuous humor, and yet you
protest this lovely film, you need something that this movie provides &#x96;
a magical mirror. Not so you can see far away, but so you can see
yourself.

I enjoyed this movie so much! I wanted to clap so many times,
especially after the Be our guest musical moment, beast&#x27;s solo or the
ending credits with Celine Dion&#x27;s new song in the background. It does
justice to the original and more! Don&#x27;t read to much into the negative reviews, just go and see it and
decide for your own!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>so magical and wonderful<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have to say my expectations were high and thankfully I didn&#x27;t have to
disappoint. The movie was magical and beautiful and everything I hoped
for. I got to laugh and cry and just feel amazing after the movie
ended. I really recommend the new Beauty and the Beast to everyone who loves
Disney movies as much as I do. This movie is definitely my new top 1
Disney movie. As for the actors, everyone were perfect. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens
had great chemistry and Luke Evans and Josh Gad were the perfect Gaston
and LaFou.Go see this movie ASAP!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>More than everything I ever hoped for<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast is one of the first movies I&#x27;ve ever watched. So,
it has very special place in my heart and probably the reason why I
love musicals so much. And this live-action remake was fantastic. At
first, I thought it was going to be the same as &#x27;91 version. But no, it
was more than that and in a positive way. I would like to thank from
director to gaffer, from lead roles to small ones and even to catering.
Thank you to those who helped to make it possible.

I&#x27;m not quite sure what film all these negative reviews were watching,
as this film was amazing. Beauty and the beast was my childhood. My favorite Disney movie. I was
worried it would be ruined by being re-made. I think it was cast
perfectly, esp Luke Evans. It&#x27;s the type of film you can fall into and
relive your childhood but in the present day.Everything was done perfectly and created with care. I loved it. Highly recommended
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An amazing retelling of a beloved story with great acting<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First of all I have to say I liked this movie more than the original.
With all the additional background stories, character developments, new
songs, it was perfect for me. Those additions made the Belle &#x26; Beast&#x27;s
love story more believable. Emma Watson&#x27;s portrayal of Belle was great. I loved how she managed to
do the character more human, which is something I didn&#x27;t see in the
previous live-action princesses like Lily James (she was good, but she
was too much two dimensional for my taste), without Watson I don&#x27;t
think it would be as good. Josh Gad, Luke Evans, Kevin Kline, Dan
Stevens all deserve a shot, they were marvelous. Even the actors who
were there most of the time with just their voices managed to do these
loved characters their own. Especially Ewan Mcgregor, he was an amazing
Lumiere. Production design, costumes, cinematography, visual effects
were all spectacular. For the new songs, my favorite was &#x22;Evermore&#x22; (
The one thing that bothers me about the criticism of the new songs is
that ,the same critics who LOVED the La La Land songs, say that the new
songs are forgettable, all I can say about this; those three songs are
better than the whole La La Land soundtrack) There are so many unnecessary criticism, all I can say about it, don&#x27;t
listen, and go enjoy the movie. I believe most of you will leave the
cinema with a big smile like I did.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Sub-Ten Sentence Reviews<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty and the beast&#x22; reprises the Disney animated classic film as a
real live version starring Emma Watson as Belle. Let me say this: it&#x27;s
unprecedented, and I really didn&#x27;t expect it, but with a tastefully
perfect re-imagination of the premise, an impressively realistic
portrayal of the non- human characters in the movie, and an overall
flawlessly adapted set design/musical arrangement, this movie is the
best film that I&#x27;ve seen in recent memory. I gotta say, this was
excellent. They perfectly captured the magic of the original, and this
was, dare i say it, JUST as good as the original. If not better. Thus,
i award this movie, for the first time ever in Sub-ten sentence
reviews, ten muhs.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautifully Done<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;m finding it hard to wrap my head around the negative reviews! As a
Disney fanatic and long time lover of the classic movie I didn&#x27;t go in
with particularly high expectations, but I was completely won over. The
whole production was stunning and the songs were brilliant (even the
new ones). Ewan McGregor and Luke Evans were stand outs for me.Loved the added back story with Belle&#x27;s mum too, really touching.In summary, I thought it was excellent! The whole cinema clapped at the
end and I have never seen that happen in this country. Speaks volumes
really.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
10 out of 10 from me... I thought it was incredibly beautiful and I can
fault nothing. Loved it from start to end and the beast song was my
favorite. I cried several times :)The cgi was beautiful, the whole setting. How they showed some of the
backstory to Belle and the Beast and how they became like that + why
the servants also got transformed and punished.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Loved it<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I am astonished that so many people have given this bad reviews when
its literally only been out since last night. Come on people. I
actually saw the movie and it was magical and amazing. The music (other
than on the one by Arianna Grande and John Legend) was astonishing. The
script was very well crafted. I loved that they showed that time was
really passing. It truly felt like the Beast and Beauty fell in love
rather than Cinderella and the Prince (insta love). I&#x27;ve seen a lot of
people saying the CGI was badly done, but I beg to differ. There was no
part of that movie that was badly done concerning CGI. Dan Stevens
played a very good beast and I was not disappointed when he turned back
into a man (unlike the original cartoon). There were a lot of people
saying they were going to avoid this film because of rumors of a &#x22;gay
scene&#x22; which is absurd partly because there wasn&#x27;t one. Please watch
the movie before writing reviews next time. Thanks. I recommend seeing
it!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I felt loved while seeing Beauty and the Beast<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie is stupendous and it went by pretty fast despite the fact
it&#x27;s 2 hours and 9 minutes. I was lucky to hear the songs before seeing
the movie. I was wearing green all over because it was St Patrick&#x27;s
Day. Emma Watson really did make a stupendous Belle. Maurice has a much
bigger role than in the animated movie. It&#x27;s about time he told Gaston
that he will never marry Belle. I always knew Kevin Kline really did
make a perfect Maurice. The CGI is stupendous and the Beast is more of
a hairy human with ram horns and fangs. Up to where Gaston tied Maurice
up to a tree, I felt like I was on his (Maurice&#x27;s) side at all times.
Whenever I think of 2 cities in northern Italy, I keep thinking of A
Tale of two cities. It&#x27;s amazing to see the castle crumbling and
friends slowly turning into antiques whenever a rose petal falls.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It is wonderful!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It may not be the original Disney animated version, but it was still
MAGICAL! I caught myself with a smile of pure delight several different
times during the movie. I&#x27;m nearly 69 so I just sat back and enjoyed
it. I think those who didn&#x27;t like it are just the type who never like
any change or remakes,
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>One of the best Disney movie ever!!!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This is my first time writing review for a movie after just finished
watching it. It is the best Disney movie for me I guess. After a long
time I really enjoyed watching a movie in theater. Great movie, love
the songs, the acting, and everything about the movie so beautiful. The
casting are so perfect and the prince and belle is just so amazing. I
am sure gonna watch it again. Do not follow the negative reviews, I was
kind of confused about the movie before going to the theater,but since
I am a big Disney fan I watched it and it just made my day. Everyone in
the theater enjoyed the movie I can tell, the movie will take you to a
fairy tale. So do not miss this one.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Fantastic film!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I came on here to rate this film and was shocked at the amount of
negative reviews that this film has. I rated it 10 out of 10 purely
because it&#x27;s a truly magical film. I love Disney and always have done, and I was a little apprehensive to
see this in case it ruined the magic of the original. However I was
enthralled from start to finish. After the initial shock of seeing
Hermione singing (HP super fan here), I was transported for two hours
into a brilliant, light hearted, funny and entertaining film. It&#x27;s
beautiful, a little sad near the end but overall I left the cinema with
a big smile on my face. This is definitely a film for all ages. If you haven&#x27;t seen it yet, go
and see it! Some people on here are so negative about the CGI and all
the effects, but it is a Disney musical film intended for kids and
loved by all ages. There&#x27;s more important things (in my eyes) that the
effects... after all isn&#x27;t that the moral of the story! Don&#x27;t judge
something by its looks alone.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great adaption of the original classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beautiful. Simply beautiful. Emma Watson is fantastic as Belle in this
and Dan Stevens makes a great Beast in this. Plus this is better then
the original animated version cause it has some backstory to it. It
shows why Prince Adam was selfish and unkind and it was because of his
father. After Prince Adams mother had died, his father who was cruel
and selfish treated him like dirt and raised him to be just like him.
When Prince Adam was transformed into the Beast he blamed his father
for his pain. Yep definitely a better backstory then the other one in
the original animated version. It also shows Belle&#x27;s backstory of when
her mother had died. She had the plague and the doctors took infant
Belle away so that she would be safe from the plagues harm. Her mother
however didn&#x27;t make it and went to Heaven. Also Gaston is the same as
he is in the original, except he leaves Maurice to be eaten by wolves
and shoots the Beast 3 times with a pistol instead of stabbing him with
a dagger and shooting him with an arrow. He didn&#x27;t even think about
using his rifle in the original film. lol. It&#x27;s also nice to see the
enchantress throughout this film instead of the original cause in the
original she is only shown at the beginning. It also has great brand
new songs and the old ones from the original film, like Evermore, Be
Our Guest, Gaston, and of course everyone&#x27;s favorite the title song.
Yep this indeed a beautiful masterpiece Disney has to offer. 10 out of
10.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Loved it! Entertaining from beginning to end!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really don&#x27;t understand all these negative reviews. I thought it was
thoroughly entertaining, I thought all the cast members were perfect, I
laughed, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat; and when I got home I
couldn&#x27;t wait to discuss it with other people who had seen it too. I&#x27;ve
downloaded the soundtrack and I can&#x27;t wait to own it on DVD. See it for
yourself before you decide. Don&#x27;t let the ridiculous negative comments
on this site ruin the film for you.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty and the Beast Review: A Magical Masterpiece.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
What a treat, Bill Condon and his star-studded cast, have in store for
their Disney followers this Spring; a soul-enchanting, heart-racing,
nail-biting adaptation of the well-loved Disney fairy-tale. Beauty and
the Beast is the story of an independent young girl, from a rural
French village, who selflessly sacrifices her own freedom for her
fathers&#x27;, after he is imprisoned by a prince, who has been transformed
into a beast, as punishment his selfish actions.Whilst most of us are familiar with the fantasy story, originally
penned in 1740 by French author, Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de
Villeneuve, (now there&#x27;s a mouthful), you may be surprised to hear that
Condon has remained faithful to almost every mesmerising moment of
Disney&#x27;s 1991 animation, whilst filling gaps in the story line, which
were not addressed in their original adaptation; for example, the
thought-provoking question of what had happened to Belle&#x27;s mother.One of the key additions to the story line, is the introduction of a
magical atlas that allows Belle (played by Emma Watson) and the Beast
(played by Dan Stevens) to visit her birthplace in Paris, where she
learns that her mother died after falling victim to the plague. Whilst
this deviates from the original, these small contextual complements,
give the story a new depth and an element of authenticity.What many viewers will find interesting too, is the new crafting of a
homosexual story line, between the infamous Gaston (played by Luke
Evans) and his smitten sidekick LeFou. This is, of course, likely to
raise a few eyebrows, and even draw disapproval from some circles, many
of whom have already voiced their opinion that it is apparently
&#x22;unsuitable for younger viewers&#x22;, despite giggling over the sexual
innuendo between Lumiere and his French-maid girlfriend. I prefer to
see this as a symbol of advancement in the social views of modern
society. The references are tastefully scripted and humorously
presented by the talented Josh Gad (who plays LeFou). Some may argue
that this comedic effect contradicts the argument of equality, but I
would counter that with a reminder that the element of comedy presented
in a &#x27;camp&#x27; manner, merely fits with LeFou&#x27;s long-held jester-like
character, and is not connected directly with the fact that he is gay.
Not all gay men are camp, after all, but LeFou, even in the original
Disney animation, was regarded as rather ostentatious.Watson&#x27;s performance, as Belle, is positively captivating, whilst Dan
Stevens&#x27; deep and dulcet tones will win over far more than just the
heroine&#x27;s heart. With the talents of Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellan and
Emma Thompson playing the parts of Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs Potts,
respectively, this all-star cast will have you singing along and
laughing like a child all over again. A beautiful adaptation of a
beautiful tale. This fun-filled, fantasy is a Disney delight for the
whole family.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Outstanding remake<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
When my wife and I got married, our theme was Beauty and the Beast. I
sang the title song during the ceremony. Needless to say, we really
love the 1991 animated version and we were somewhat cautious about
seeing this remake.Our fears were totally unfounded. This was awesome - Disney at its
best. The talented and lovely Emma Watson is just perfect as Belle and
the Beast is....well, very beastly! Gaston is still a colossal jerk and
the ballroom scene when Mrs. Potts sings Beauty and the Beast had us
both in tears.We are going to go see this movie again, probably a couple of times
more!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Amazing Best Movie Of 2017<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was exited for this movie to be released in the cinema, it was quite
an unforgettable experience going to see this movie. i thought it would
be about eight stars out of ten, but as it turns out it is actually ten
, it was really quite an entertaining movie, Emma Watson was brilliant
as Belle, she just seemed to get it just right. Seeing Beauty and the
Beast, was well worth it, it had the right mixture of charm, and dark
moments in this movie, Gaston (Luke Evans) was a great version of
Gaston, in the movie when i first saw Gaston appear on the screen, i
automatically knew that they had got the casting right. The movie was
funny charming and sad all at the same time, i actually thought i was
going to cry, in the scene where Belle and the Beast dance together,
the film was slightly different to the original but didn&#x27;t seem to
loose the atmosphere that the original brought to its audience.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Most Beautiful Film ever<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast the original, was already so good. This live
action adaptation is an example of how to maintain something so perfect
from the original, but upgrade it to a MASTERPIECE. This movie made me
laugh, cry, being at the edge of my seat during the screening, remember
so many memories and really emotional.I love how they give every character more depth, Belle&#x27;s mom story was
heartbreaking. I love her little song in Paris (How does a moment last
forever) I think it was the best number, after Evermore. It was so raw,
it was so honest, Watson is AMAZING! completely NAILED HER PERFORMANCE.The music was perfect, I LOVE ALL THE NEW SONGS and the tweaks on the
old ones. THIS MOVIE WAS BUILD TO PERFECTION. I think one of the funniest scenes is when Madam De Garderobe jumps
from the balcony to be closer to Maestro Cadenza, I&#x27;m so in love with
these two characters.I believed this Movie is going to be the Movie event of the Year, it is
BEAUTIFIL (literally) all the sets, all the photography of the film.
GOSH it is beautiful! Surprinsingly it is VERY SAD at times, but as all Disney movies
Goodness prevails. A MUST WATCH, THIS MOVIE IS PERFECTION.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It&#x27;s not New York Metropolitan Opera vocal quality.  AND I DON&#x27;T CARE!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
DISCLAIMER: I am head-over-heels in love with Emma Watson. I am
predisposed to love anything she does because she does it.DISCLAIMER: I am head-over-heels in love with Alan Menken. If he writes
the music, I&#x27;m there.DISCLAIMER: I love loving things. I hate hating things. It makes no
sense to me to equate intelligence with the ability to find fault.
Sometimes I see what they were going for and applaud the effort.
Sometimes I see what they were going for and weep at how badly they
missed it.That being said, I LOVED the new &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;. I was wiping
tears from the corners of my eyes frequently for sheer beauty.The original cartoon I loved. Even though there were holes in the plot
you could drive a battleship through. They fixed all the plot holes! Go
see it, if only for that! Okay, okay, Emma Watson isn&#x27;t a classically-trained coloratura soprano.
She&#x27;s no Paige O&#x27;Hara vocally. For that matter, I missed Jerry Orbach
when Ewen MacGregor was singing &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; and I missed Angela
Lansbury in Emma Thompson&#x27;s &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22;. I understand Orbach
is no longer available and the supernatural Ms. Lansbury, in her 90&#x27;s,
probably couldn&#x27;t do the song the justice she did a quarter of a
century ago. Guess what. I DON&#x27;T CARE! They did justice to the songs.
They didn&#x27;t do brilliance with the songs. I don&#x27;t care.Emma has a divinely expressive face that carries her emotions perfectly
for the big screen. Her Belle was glorious.Is it possible to miscast Kevin Kline? He is brilliant. And his Maurice
is delicious. His singing, still not New York Metropolitan Opera
quality, carries the song.Luke Evans does just the lightest touch of camp in playing Gaston. I
reveled in it! Once again, not the vocal quality of Richard White, and
I did miss that amazing bass. But the baritone/tenor carried it off.Now, let&#x27;s get to Josh Gad.Bill Condon did the lightest hat tip to the Gender Community with Josh
Gad&#x27;s Lefou. If you blink, you might miss it. If you&#x27;re terrified your
little ones might get gay cooties on them and grow up &#x22;perverts&#x22;, by
all means skip this show. But you&#x27;d probably better not let them watch
any television, listen to any music, or attend any movies, because the
portrayals there are not teensy hat-tips. They are full-body bows and
curtsies.Now for the real star of the show: The music.Alan Menken is a living miracle. He does things with a musical score
and songs that blow me through the wall! All the new songs are
brilliant! Beast&#x27;s song of pain over Belle is stunning. THOSE vocals
are magnificent! I&#x27;ve always loved the opening number of &#x22;Beauty and
the Beast&#x22;. It is full-blown grand opera, and makes me wish Alan Menken
would write a sure-enough opera.This movie dazzled me visually, musically, and emotionally. Yes, there
are some things that seemed to me flaws. Guess what. I don&#x27;t care! You
have my highest recommendation.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Absolutely fantastic!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Ignore the critics. This is a fantastic adaptation of the movie. Not
sure why people are comparing CGI to the original animated film. They
are two different technologies and two different looks altogether.
People trying to be &#x22;critics&#x22; just want to project like they are pros
in reviewing movies. Emma Watson is the perfect Belle, I cannot imagine
anyone else portraying her. I love her acting and singing. The rest of
the cast are fantastic as well. Go see it, you won&#x27;t regret it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Wonderful. The Animated Film Brought to Life<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; wasn&#x27;t exactly risky. The original is beloved,
and it never seemed to change aspects of the story like &#x22;Maleficent.&#x22;
(a film I&#x27;m not fond of for many reasons, one of them being the drastic
departure from the source material). The story wasn&#x27;t the risk at all,
if the trailers were to be believed. The question was more the cast. An
incredibly talented cast, mind you; Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke
Evans, Josh Gad, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, and many more. But
despite the talent, a part of me still worried that they wouldn&#x27;t be
able to bring the story to life like in the 1991 classic. Emma Watson
was the only one I had full faith in walking in, seeing as many of them
would be voices alone and, up until Marvel&#x27;s &#x22;Legion,&#x22; I had no idea
who Dan Stevens was.Well, they proved me wrong almost instantly. Everyone present in every
scene gives stellar performances, Gaston never feeling over the top
(well, the character himself is over the top, in a way, but he never
feels here more over the top than he should be), and special effects
allowing the Beast to come to fruition in a spectacular way that looks
almost frighteningly real. The first half hour or so captured the tale perfectly, and while I
really liked it, it was nothing compared to what was to come. By the
time the film ended, I had almost teared up more than once, and a huge
smile was on my face during essentially every scene.The cinematography is gorgeous, often springing right out of the
animation. Colors are vibrant, the aesthetic of every area real. From
the Beast&#x27;s castle to Belle&#x27;s village, everything feels right and true,
as if you could reach into the screen and experience it all. Many of the songs, like the story itself, carries over from the &#x27;91
version. However, there are some notable additions, and all are
welcome.What was added to the plot was great, if almost--but not quite--
inconsequential. It flows so exceptionally that it takes a moment to
even register as new.Overall, do you love the original Disney film? Yes? See this. Did you
never experience the original, but want to? See this. Do you like great
films, especially when Disney&#x27;s magical touch is present? See this. How
anyone could hate this is beyond me, and the overwhelmingly positive
response is deserved without a doubt.

-Beauty and the Beast-Status: APPROVEDDisney&#x27;s animated classic takes on a new form, with a widened mythology
and an all-star cast. A young prince, imprisoned in the form of a
beast, can be freed only by true love. What may be his only opportunity
arrives when he meets Belle, the only human girl to ever visit the
castle since it was enchanted.What I liked:&#x95;If this movie wasn&#x27;t the most magical Disney movie ever created, I
wanna know what is&#x95;Beautiful set and beautiful cinematography&#x95;Good acting from its cast&#x95;Actually improves upon the original. That&#x27;s right, this is better than
the original from the 90&#x27;s&#x95;Singing is good&#x95;The CGI isn&#x27;t distracting like I thought it would be.&#x95;Great family film&#x95;Had a smile on my face through the whole runtime&#x95;Adds to the story&#x95;Overall, just such a fantastic movie. I couldn&#x27;t imagine how Disney
could ever top this live- action remake&#x95;The 3-D is engaging, even 2-D is probably equally engagingWhat I didn&#x27;t like:&#x95;This didn&#x27;t affect the way I see the movie, but something odd happened
at the very end that was kinda off...it was only like 3 seconds so it
doesn&#x27;t really matterConsensus: This movie was all around such an amazing experience. I expected the
movie maybe to be a bar below the original or at least matching it, but
I didn&#x27;t expect to like this version even more than the already beloved
original! I&#x27;m delighted to say that everything that this movie does is
great. Emma Watson really does make Belle come to life on screen. It
has a great cast, the movie itself has such a magic feel to it, and it
approves upon its amazing source material. I seriously could not
recommend this enough, go with your family and SEE THIS FILM. You will
not regret it.

I haven&#x27;t written a review in a couple years, but seeing the negative
reaction to this film, I had to act. First of all, I watched the 3D version , it was magical to say the
least. Secondly, I&#x27;m that millennial who loves Harry Potter so I would
have a soft spot when it comes to Emma Watson. You have to keep in mind this is a children movie, it&#x27;s not supposed to
be the next God Father. Also, it&#x27;s kind of hard to make a movie when
people already know the plot. They still managed to get that suspension
at the end, even though everybody knows how it ends. The movie is beautifully done. Scenes are like in a fairy tale as it
should be. They spared no money on costumes. Decoration is
breathtaking. Cast choice is appropriate. Music is beautiful.I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the Beast CGI. I thought it looked great!
All the objects in the castle have a personality and they make you
forget it&#x27;s just CGI. Emma Watson as Belle is the best choice in my opinion. She is stunning
in the film and has done a great job being the outcast farmer girl. But
again, I&#x27;m a fan so that may be a little skewed. Most of the Disney princess movies have become classics that children
often look up to. I wouldn&#x27;t mind my children looking up to the Emma
Watson Belle. Bottom line: this movie keeps the original plot, at the same time
provides us a beautiful display of choreography, charming music,
fascinating scenery. And most importantly, this movie provides us another classic Disney
princess movie!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Spoiler free review of Beauty and the Beast. A beautiful film with incredible acting and mesmerizing visuals.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast was an amazing movie. It was a great remake of the
original animated version with extra added parts that only improved the
story.I have to admit, I did not have the highest hopes for this movie. I
found the trailers looked alright, and decided to go see it after a few
of my friends told me how good it was. I was stunned at how good it
was.I&#x27;ll start with the visuals. The visuals were stunning. It was such a
beautiful movie to watch, from the animation to shots of the castle,
forest, and village. The costume design was spot on, as well as hair
and makeup.Next, the acting. Emma Watson was a perfect Belle. She was a strong
female lead, smart, brave, and caring. She did such a good job of
acting that I could only see her as Belle while I was watching the
movie, despite having known her as Hermione for so long. Gaston was
also spot on. He was the same arrogant character as we all remember. I
thought that the Beast could have been a bit better at the start, but
he improved throughout the film. I thought the other characters, such
as LeFou and Maurice were very well done.Now, the story. This movie follows the original story, while adding
some more in to make it a deeper, better story in my opinion. We are
given some backstory on the Beast and Belle. I find the way the plot
unfolds is more believable than in the original. The relationship
between Belle and the Beast seems a lot more genuine.Finally, the music. I had my doubts about Emma Watson&#x27;s singing
capabilities, but I was blown away with how beautiful her voice
sounded. The dance numbers are fun, with great choreography. Be Our
Guest has some of the most beautiful animation. The songs from the
original are there, along with some new ones that all together make an
incredible soundtrack.Overall, this was a beautiful movie and I suggest if you haven&#x27;t seen
it yet, to rush to the nearest theater and watch it.

I never usually write reviews but this film deserves one and seeing all
the negative comments and reviews really annoys me as there is nothing
bad to say about this film in any way! Emma Watson was perfect as
Belle, as was Dan Stevens as the beast and together they had great
chemistry. Every song just got better and the story was more or less
exactly the same as the 1991 original. And the dance scene stole it for
me, just WOW. Don&#x27;t understand how it can be said its average or even
terrible. Best Disney adaptation for me
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Worth every penny!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I do not write reviews based on technical aspects. I go see movies to
take me from the norm of life. This movie did exactly that for me. It
was excellent in every sense. The actors brought the characters to life
better than I could have imagined. People, in my opinion, tend to
forget what movies are meant to do. Just enjoy them. This movie was
graceful, enchanting and for goodness sake, the gay part was not that
big a deal.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Outstanding<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really don&#x27;t understand where the negative reviews are coming from.
Its the most visually beautiful film I&#x27;ve ever seen. The casting was
great and I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off the screen. For those of you who
may be swayed by meta scores less than 8 (like myself), lets take it
with a grain of salt. I&#x27;ve noticed a common theme of comparing this
version with the original, which i think is unfair. I watched the
original for the first time a few weeks ago. Forgive me, but i was not
awed. I cant help but wonder if at least some of the low scores are
based not on the superiority of the original, but the superiority of
that time in these folks&#x27; lives -- nostalgia. Just a thought. Beautiful
film. Im not a 3-D fan, but it really was amazing for this.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Beast of Manufactured Nostalgia<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney continues its unprecedented line of rebooted, re-imagined, and
refurbished live-action remakes with the new fangled Beauty and the
Beast. And much like last year&#x27;s Jungle Book (2015) and Pete&#x27;s Dragon
(2015) this one injects just as much chemical perfection into its
innards as a robot arm would bestow a Twinkie. It&#x27;s not a necessary
movie per se. But its unabashed zeal and fidelity to the source
material (the Disney-fied 1991 film not the Jeanne-Marie Leprince de
Beaumont tome) has a certain giddiness to it; a certain manufactured
innocence.I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all well versed by now on the self-described &#x22;Tale as
Old as Time.&#x22; A precocious Belle (Watson) falls in love with a surly
Beast (Stevens) whose secret heart of gold is hidden underneath layers
of loneliness, sadness and fur. There&#x27;s an enchanted castle, a witch&#x27;s
curse, singing silverware, inexplicable walks through wintry forests
without a coat - its basic fairy tale stuff really. Difference this
time is Disney has carefully and lovingly set its story on its perch
like butterfly taxidermy in frame. Most everything you remember from
Beauty and the Beast (1991) is in this film, and everything you don&#x27;t
remember is just a tiny bit better.What parts you may ask? Well arguably the best thing about Beauty and
the Beast is the way it quietly updates the gender politics of the
material and does so without feeling pushy or preachy. Much ado was
made of the ultimately benign gay character that nearly everyone failed
to notice the first (and second) bi-racial kiss in a Disney film. As
for Belle, Paige O&#x27;Hara certainly had her moment as the progressive
page-turning princess but Emma Watson&#x27;s take on the character comes
with a dream of traveling to the great white somewhere and (sort of)
accomplishes it. Speaking of which, Watson positively runs away with
this role; dawning natural sincerity while belting out gorgeous
melodies like she&#x27;s not even trying.Do you remember Gaston? In the animated version, the vain
hunter-in-chief of Belle&#x27;s little town had all the charm of a
nefarious, dark-haired Johnny Bravo. Here however Luke Evans&#x27;s
meat-headed take on the popular villain pops with campy fun. His
interactions with LeFou (Gad), up to and including the song &#x22;Gaston,&#x22;
are easily the best parts of the movie.Yet while these minor improvements are sure to win over the nostalgic,
the case against Beauty and the Beast proves much more interesting, at
least from a filmic perspective. First let&#x27;s start with the added songs
provided by B&#x26;B originator Alan Menken and replacement lyricist Tim
Rice. While the songs do their best to slink underneath the film&#x27;s
major melodies, their lack of Howard Ashman&#x27;s lyrical wordplay and
effortless charm clash like burlap underneath layers of purple satin.Additionally Bill Condon&#x27;s persnickety attention to detail works for
the mechanics of the film to the detriment of the narrative. Every cut,
every structural progression, feels stiflingly familiar, and can&#x27;t help
but make everything look paler when compared to the original.
Considering the way the film was shot and cut, the middling filler
looks presentable while the big scenes all seem overwhelmed by clutter.
This is most evident in &#x22;Be Our Guest,&#x22; when Lumiere (McGregor) our
photo-realistic French candelabra fills the screen with gauche CGI
chaos. It is at that moment I realized; the best part of the 1991
version is the worst part about this one.Yet despite, its various faults, I can&#x27;t help but admire this posh
little remake. It&#x27;s a begrudging admiration, like the kind of
ambivalence I increasingly feel towards Marvel movies. Only unlike
Marvel, which tricks you into thinking you haven&#x27;t seen all this
before, Disney live-action remakes all but announce you&#x27;ve seen this
all before, only you shouldn&#x27;t care. It looks like we&#x27;ll have to wait a
little bit longer before killing this beast.

I don&#x27;t know if this is the new place to be rude and nasty and
Trollsome (is that a word lol) since IMDb rightfully took away our
Message Board privilages, But I don&#x27;t understand what Y&#x27;all are talking
about. This movie was AMAZING. Besides every overwhelmingly positive
review i have seen about this movie, Every person I know directly or
indirectly that has seen this movie was amazed by it. Every desciption
that I have gotten (including my own) was full of goose bumps and
tears. (Tears, of course, of love, excitement, nostalgia.) When I saw
it, the people (aged very young, boy and girl.. to grown-up boy and
girl) were packed into the theatre and vocalized throughout the show
their appreciation of it, ending in a rounding applause at the end of
the movie. BOOM. Visually stunning and an Amazing Cast. Updating the
original movie, but sticking close to it. BRAVO!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>From a True Fan: A beautiful expansion on the original version<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
True fans of the original Beauty and the Beast animated movie will love
this updated version. It cannot replace the original, and it should not
necessarily be compared to the original. I watched the animated movie
well over 100 times during my life, as it was my favorite Disney movie
as a kid. I was captivated by this story, and Belle as a character. She
was a strong female lead - adventurous, head-strong, and determined -
at a time when there were not that many strong female characters on the
screen for little girls. Emma Watson&#x27;s version of Belle expands on
Belle as a fearless pioneer in her small village. She is absolutely
fearless! I actually liked Emma&#x27;s Belle better than the original. In
all the scenes where she was scared and questioning in the original,
here Emma approaches everything head-on, no second guessing herself and
her abilities, she just knows she can do anything. I can&#x27;t help but
think she is going to be a wonderful role model for all those little
girls out there enjoying this movie. Actually, if I read one more daft
review by some dude who wants to comment on how the movie isn&#x27;t up to
par and how &#x22;fake&#x22; everything looks, I will throw myself from the
tower! Can I say that I&#x27;m obsessed with the Beast and the actor Dan Stevens,
who I was not familiar with before. The writers made his character so
complex and rich. The new song that Alan wrote for him called
&#x22;Evermore&#x22; has been playing on repeat on my Spotify for days. It is so
beautifully written and performed. It is absolutely everything! I
always wondered why the Beast didn&#x27;t have a song in the original. It
was well worth the 26 year wait! Dan really brought this character to
life - and in all his interviews you can tell how proud he is of all
his hard work on stilts and getting into the character of the Beast. The rest of the cast was also amazing! Luke Evans was the perfect
Gaston and Josh Gad - they could not have found a better LeFou. The two
of them working together was really a treat. I keep seeing all these reviews about how everything was CGI and
everything looked so fake in the movie - seriously? When you have a
movie where the majority of characters are inanimate objects, I&#x27;m not
quite sure what these people were expecting. I&#x27;m not sure how Disney
was supposed to have a non-CGI candlestick, or a CGi candlestick that
looks 100% real. The technology is amazing, but it will never look
exactly real. Also, in regards to the Beast, if people would look at
interviews and information on the filming they would know that Disney
attempted to fuse two types of technologies for the Beast in this
movie. They tried something new that had never been done, which is the
have Dan play all his parts in live action, on stilts, in a 40 pound
muscle suit with Emma, and then play it again in a booth with facial
recognition to get the facial expressions of a real human. The face was
matched with the body later. Pretty spectacular stuff, if you think
about it. If you look at the expressions of Beast during the movie, you
will notice how lifelike his expressions are. They did any amazing job
and probably made it as real as it could possibly look. I&#x27;m sure it
turned out so much better that way, than if they had someone in a
costume, or a completely CGI Beast. I am really tired of people
complaining for the sake of complaining about the visuals. It is not
real life, and never will be, it does not mean you can&#x27;t enjoy the
film. Overall the movie was amazing! If you are a TRUE fan of this movie and
have memorized every word to every song, like I have, you will love it
and be inspired. I certainly am ignoring all the haters and enjoying my
time in this magical world.

I enjoyed the casting of this film very much. Kevin Kline was great as
the father, and since most of the cast had live theater experience it
felt more like a traditional musical. Not sure why there are such
negative reviews. It is a sweet story that doesn&#x27;t need to be overdone.
The costumes were lovely as well. Nice!

20 March 2017 Film of choice at the Plaza Dorchester tonight - Beauty
and the Beast. If I was only allowed to use one word to describe this
film I guess it would be spectacular, but I&#x27;m glad there are more words
available as I want to use a lot of them. This film was sumptuous,
extravagant, romantic, dark, joyful, and spectacular. Emma Watson was
the perfect casting for Belle as she radiated naivety, beauty and the
compassion we come to expect of this character. Dan Stevens played the
beast and brought a tenderness to the part. Luke Evans shone as Gaston
oozing stupidity, boorishness and an evil sly malevolence when he
didn&#x27;t get his own way. This live action version of the Disney
animation excelled in what it does best, bringing the stories of our
imagination alive on the screen. There were moments of joy, moments of
sorrow, moments that made us laugh and that made us cry, and although
we all know the story, I find myself still willing the good guys to win
as the film comes to its glorious conclusion. Although I knew who most
of the cast were, it was still a wonderful moment when the true
characters of the household objects were revealed. I must applaud the
costume department and the people in charge of the set, I feel I could
watch this film every week for year and look behind the characters to
see something new every time. A truly magnificent piece of cinema
suitable for the whole family is it a watch and definitely going to be
part of my DVD collection. I urge you all to go and see it.

I just saw Beauty in 3D...I saw it with an 8 year old ....I think I
liked it more than she did!! It was beautifully done....fabulous
cinematography....wonderful acting....the actor that played Gaston was
purr-fect...Kevin Kline did an excellent job as the father and Emma
Watson has grown into a classic beauty and was totally believable as
Belle...I saw the national touring show when it came to The Ahmanson in
LA..I saw the cartoon...this is its own creation. Its a wonderful movie
for adults..I thought it was very adult...and Bravo and Brava to the
production team and entire cast. You will love it!! Is everything La La
Land was not!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Incredible!  Better than the original.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
2017&#x27;s live action remake of Disney&#x27;s beauty and the beast is by far
better than the original 1991 film. First off, the visual effects and
designs are absolutely breathtaking! The set designs are so eloquent
and beautiful. Then the costumes, the period costumes are very true to
the original and accurate. And the casting is one hundred percent
perfect. Emma Watson is a great Belle, she looks a lot like her, speaks
a lot like her, and represents the starring character very well. Dan
Stevens is good beast, even though you don&#x27;t get to see him in human
form till the very end. And throughout the rest of the film the CGI is
so well done and the Beast looks great, doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. I
enjoyed Kevin Kline as belles father very much, he just looks like the
character when you first see him and when he talks you just know that
was a perfect casting decision. I adored Emma Thompson as Miss Potts,
her beautiful singing voice gave me chills, she lit up the screen.
There could not have been a better casting choice for LaFou other than
Josh Gadd, and if anyone was surprised by his character being gay then
I seriously wonder if you have ever seen original film, I applaud
Disney for promoting diversity and even giving his character a love
interest at the end. Luke Evans as Gaston could not have been better!
The writing is very similar to the original animation and it works very
well. The musical numbers will blow you away and fill you with awe and
wonder. Be my guest is absolutely wonderful. I honestly can&#x27;t say
anything bad about this wonderful film. Take someone to BE YOUR GUEST
and go see this! 10/10
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Much better than the original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I have only written reviews for maybe one or two other movies, so that
is how passionately I feel about this film.This is the best live-action Disney remake thus far. And I absolutely
loved Cinderella and The Jungle Book. I&#x27;m so sad there are such
negative reviews for this film, and I don&#x27;t really get why, either.I loved the original. It deserved the first ever animated film
nominated for Best Picture. With that being said, this 2017 adaption
absolutely perfected, modernized and matured the original. Emma Watson
is the perfect Belle; she also makes her more independent, self-aware
and bad-ass. She&#x27;s the perfect 2017 Disney princess. Luke Evans also
kills it as Gaston. He has an incredible singing voice and really
brings the character to life.The CGI really blows it out of the water. &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;, the huge
number in the original, is the best part of the film. I was clapping
and gasping at how stunning the scene was. It&#x27;s one of the best musical
sequences I have ever seen and 99.9999% of it was CGI. I loved the new songs and character backstories as well. They weren&#x27;t
too much, and I felt like they were appropriately spaced out. Ewan McGregor, Ewan McKellen and Emma Thompson were INCREDIBLE casting
choices and truly gave it their all, despite only physically being on
screen for a few short moments. On to the &#x22;gay moment&#x22; controversy: LaFou, who is overwhelmingly gay in the cartoon, is much less of the
&#x22;butt-of-the- joke&#x22; sidekick in this adaption. He is definitely
comedic, for that&#x27;s the role of LaFou, but he is also very
level-headed, despite his affection for Gaston. I like that they made
him more flamboyant, because, as stated, he is overwhelmingly gay.
Also, I loved that they made an effort to show him switch from a female
to male dance partner in that &#x22;gay scene&#x22; that shocked the nation. It
gave him a happy ending, which he very much deserved, and overall
humanized him, despite being the &#x22;bad guy&#x27;s sidekick&#x22;. Overall, the effects, production design, sound, acting, singing and
directing were phenomenal. I hope the online scores improve when more
people see it - this film is truly special, and really sticks to the
original while very much making it its own. If anything, go see it for the incredible cast! You will NOT be let
down.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>An amazing remake that could be better than the original!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was going into the movie not expecting TOO much. Boy was I surprised!
I loved the movie from beginning to end! It was a truly faithful
remake. Though there were a few added parts, I feel like they strongly
added to the story in a meaningful way. All of the classic songs are
included and well done! I highly encourage this to anyone who loved the
original.

THIS FILM IS AMAZING!!!! Emma Watson is surprisingly amazing as Belle,
the musical numbers are brilliant and above all the new music is so
captivating the audience was cheering in between the numbers. Gaston is
great, LeFou is great, Mrs. Potts is great, Cogsworth is Great, Belle
is Great, The Beast is Great, the Story is Great, the Library is great,
the ballroom is pulchritudinous, the costumes are great! I LOVED IT

I still remember back in May 2016 when they announced the first Trailer
for Beauty and the Beast would be airing tomorrow on Good Morning
America and that night...I didn&#x27;t sleep a wink! The anticipation was
incredible, like going to sleep on Christmas Eve! Although it was only
a teaser, as soon as the piano played that infamous opening theme, I
felt my eyes well up with tears. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I was
this excited for a movie. Now 10 months later, it&#x27;s all over. The
cartoon version is my favourite Disney film so needless to say, I set
the bar high, and there would be hell to pay should the 1991 film be
dismissed or tarnished. Let&#x27;s begin with the obvious: The Cast.
Everyone has had their own ideas about who were the ideal choices but I
feel they got everyone right on this one. A healthy blend of Broadway
stage actors and film actors gave the heart and soul needed to this
film. Those criticizing Emma for not being a &#x22;singer&#x22; need to cut her a
break. When casting a role in a live action musical, more must be
considered beyond singing ability such as a recognizable face as well
as mannerisms that embody the spirit of the character (like Audrey
Hepburn over Julie Andrews in My Fair Lady). Now with the demand of a
live action film where previous cartoon incarnations of this character
were rendered with a combination of computers, drawings, and an actor
who only provided a voice, the complete package must be sought in your
leading lady. While not a Broadway singer, Watson&#x27;s portrayal of Belle
comes across as Honest, impassioned, and earnest when expressing
through song, her yearning for something more. I am not familiar with
Dan Stevens or Luke Evans prior work but whatever it was that Director
Bill Condon saw in them, he was right. The emotional ebb and flow that
Beast suffers weaves its way into your heart of seeing him as more than
just filled with rage without reason. This is showcased the best in the
new song &#x22;Evermore&#x22;. I was in tears at his broken heart when he
releases Belle. He was not born a beast, he was made a beast. Stevens
was the right choice. As regrettable as it is to have to give adulation
to a character who gives himself plenty enough as it is, the show was
undeniably stolen by Luke Evans as Gaston. While the cartoon version
has almost more of a comedic element to him until close to the end,
this Gaston reveals his true sinister capabilities beyond his unbridled
narcissism much sooner, and the audience has a much stronger contempt
for Gaston for reasons other than his unhindered persistence of our
heroine. The supporting cast does their job exactly as expected among
Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs Potts with little deviation from that of
their cartoon counterparts, and appropriately so. McGregor does quite a
service singing Be Our Guest which, let&#x27;s be honest, is THE song that
comes to mind when people think of this movie, so much that it becomes
a tagline with nearly everything to do with it, and Emma Thompson
retains all the emotion and simplistic charm in the eponymous song
during the infamous ballroom scene that is guaranteed to leave no eye
in the audience dry. The scenery of the film leaves little to be
desired in the ways of design, as it all suits the architecture of this
fantasy world. However, with the kind of financial position an
entertainment company like Disney has, I did find that some scenes
could have benefited to be shot on live locations. There could have
been expansions of atmospheric and emotional enrichment from the
addition of an actual dense and dark snow sprinkled forest or a real
golden sun kissed barley field embraced by a cloudless baby blue sky
when Belle emphatically proclaims her desire for &#x22;adventure in the
great wide somewhere&#x22; instead of what were all clearly soundstages in
the Disney studio backlot. As for the additions to the story, I felt
they were all very well written and did nothing but add to the depth
and dimensions of our protagonists. Knowing about Belles mother and
Beasts parents were a welcomed addition to what up until now was only
answered with conjecture. Let us not forget as well that the 1991
cartoon was a hand drawn piece of work culminating in 2 years to
produce an 85 minute film. The addition of another 35 minutes to match
the new one would&#x27;ve added a year to schedule and millions in
production costs. These additions are not the frivolous and unnecessary
expansions that left so many fans disillusioned with the Star Wars
trilogy. Finally&#x85;the music. What can be said of Alan Menken and the
late Howard Ashmen&#x27;s ingenious music and lyrics that haven&#x27;t already
been stated? While some new songs written by Menken may not stand up to
the old classic numbers of this story, they certainly don&#x27;t take away
anything from it either. As mentioned before, the song Evermore is a
much welcomed addition that brings a tear to any man who knows the
bitter taste of heartbreak. The added sidenote that Disney&#x27;s people
scoured the archives and found Ashmen&#x27;s lyrics cut from these songs,
and are now included in this new film is a particularly touching and
heartfelt homage to a man of such tremendous creativity and genius.
Affectionately remembered by his friends and family and immortalized in
his lyrics, it is a shame that he were not here to see this beautiful
film nearly 26 years after the original. To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his
soul, we will be forever grateful.Though it may not have the prestige of being &#x22;original&#x22;, I have no
doubt that this film will continue to inspire legions of new Disney
fans and reinvigorate the dreams of the old ones. Well Done!!

Beauty and the Beast has always been my favorite movie ever since I was
little. I have been dying to see this movie, and I was not
disappointed. I thought it was beautifully made, the characters are
still charming and lovable (in regards to all the CGI). Disney did a
wonderful job with this one.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>don&#x27;t fall for the reviews<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie was simply amazing from start to finish. Not only does it
capture the charm of the original but the cast fit their roles
perfectly. The music was on point, the cgi was outstanding and the
singing was simply beautiful. It did exactly what it was meant to do,
which was bring a cartoon classic to life.Also to anyone who was refraining from seeing this because of LeFou,
please reconsider that. He actually seemed more homosexual in the
cartoon and Disney cut out him wrapping a belt around Gaston&#x27;s neck in
this film(where as he does in the cartoon). You see him dance with

This tale as old as time was greatly remade with a few nice touches:1)Gaston is really vile in this.2)Beast and Belle&#x27;s backstory are revealed.3)LeFou is redeemed.4)Extended look at the witch(Agatha/The Enchantress)5)The backstory of the staff and their guilt.I found the characters to be well represented and some of their roles
were extended in a natural yet satisfactory way:1)Belle:Emma Watson gets to expand her original story to a point where
we now know why she ended up in a small,provincial town full of simple
people.She is raised to be powerful and independent.After the dance
scene with her prince all I could see was Belle and not Emma.Her
song,Belle was well timed,sang and arranged making everyone participate
and it put in perspective everyone&#x27;s take on her.She became an inventor
now and is attracted to create,given her parents were both artists.Also
she made reading more than a hobby,for her it was an escapism,and it
felt natural seeing her at the dinner table with a book.She even wants
to educate the other girls,to make them grow up into respectable
members of the society.2)The Beast/Prince Adam:Dan Stevens was perfect.He embodied the cruel
aspect of his character well and still was able to portray his humanity
better than the original could,his eyes were magic and shown
dependence,uncertainty,sadness.His character was a sweet boy who lost
his mother and was shaped into a luxurious,superficial,extravagant and
material man,by his dear father.He finds in Belle an equal and is shown
to be more mannered than his animated representation,also more
intellectual given the fact he is transformed at a latter age.He is
cured in the end and becomes the man Belle helped to shape:a
loving,caring and sure man.His original song &#x22;Evermore&#x22; was my
favorite,the lyrics are deep and really offer a journey in depth into
his mind and soul and the way it was done in the movie went even
further to represent his love and loss of Belle.3)Gaston:Luke Evans landed the role magically and helped the viewers to
go behind the looks and see a truly vile,malevolent character,who all
his life was after the big prize,Belle and Beast&#x27;s head.He abandons all
and uses manipulation on his fellow citizens to make Maurice seem mad
and uses his cruelty to leave the poor man bound to a try for the
wolves.He even abandons his best friend and confidant to take what he
thought was rightfully his.His song is a jolly combination of humor and
dance.And his lead in &#x22;Kill the Beast&#x22; shows his thirst for blood and
war also his madness.4)LeFou:Josh Gad finally gave the character a redemption,turning him
into a more lovable self after he was blinded for years by the
admiration for his friend,who turned out to be unworthy of him.5)Maurice:Kevin Kline is tasked to portray a guardian and an
intelligent man who lost so much:a home,the woman he loved and is
tasked to raise his daughter.He grooms her with all the aspects he
loved at her mother,mostly intelligence,taste and over time becomes
overly protective. What I particularly liked about him was his
lucidity,he wasn&#x27;t that mad inventor who should end up behind bars
because he put people in danger with his constructs.He faces many
trials,some new ones being left to be eaten by wolves and sent to an
asylum.6)The staff:All seem on point,but for me the best was Ewan(Lumiere).He
seemed more stylish than his animated counterpart.We learn now why in
the end the staff accepts their fate,a good explanation which adds to
the depth of the characters.7)Agatha/The Enchantress:She has the role to teach everyone a valuable
lesson of how deceiving can one appearance be.She also leaves the magic
book which helps expand Belle&#x27;s story.She lives in the same town as
Belle,among common people.She aids Maurice and heals him,proving she
has love for the people who are worth her time and is back at the end
to lift the spell and make everyone remember the kingdom they once
loved.This new addition to the curse offered a good explanation and
tied some loose ends,also that everything is rejuvenated with the once
cursed rose,strengthening the motif of the royal flower.They way the used the special effects made me wake up in a real fairy
tail,where everything came to life as things progressed.The actual
death of the beast and the curse being fulfilled even for a time added
tragedy to what it seem a remediable dilemma at times.The songs were redone to the letter and the new ones are a fine
addition to already a classic ensemble.My favorite as I earlier
mentioned is Evermore because I can identify with the song very well.
Celine Dion is back and her new song &#x22;How does a moment last forever&#x22;
offers us a great lesson about love,life and is sang in her
distinct,mild voice,with her specific intonation which adds to the
melancholy and the message of it.&#x22;Be our Guest&#x22; was better done here,on
a smaller scale but very melodic,spectacular and charmingly
presented(The French way).&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; touched me,but I still
prefer the original version,Angela is the mistress of the song.I loved this movie and I feel we should all enjoy it and learn
something from it while we travel trough this classic french fairy
tail.

Beauty and The Beast (2017):
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww I wast just left in awe
after watching this charming adaptation of 1991 classic film.If there
are two adaptations of a charming tale,we would have a chance to select
one as our favorite as any one of them may fall less than other.But
that does not apply the same with Beauty and the Beast because both the
animated one and present live action one are true classics and Emma
Watson is a perfect Belle one would ever see.Plot: Belle (Emma Watson), the elfin beauty from a humble French
village whose poor old dad (Kevin Kline) is imprisoned by a wicked
beast who lives in a remote castle. This is in fact a once handsome
prince (Dan Stevens), transformed into a monster by an enchantress as a
punishment for his selfishness, while all his simpering courtiers were
turned into household appliances such as candles and clocks. Belle
offers to be his prisoner in her father&#x27;s place. Gradually the grumpy,
soppy old Beast falls in love with her and she with him.Plus Points:1)Emma Watson: I can spend almost an entire day watching Emma Watson in
that gorgeous yellow gown in the ball dance scene.Aaahh!!! How Lovely
She Is! It is her charm which not only help the breakage of curse of
the castle but also our busy work minded minds.Emma Watson is a demure,
doll-like Belle, almost a figure who has stepped off the top of a music
box; she never gives in to extravagant emotion, or retreats into
depression, but maintains a kind of even-tempered dignified romantic
solitude. .Her charming presence and her lovely voice is enchanting.No
other actress would suite Belle like Emma Watson.From today.Emma Watson
is not only the clever witch Hermione but also our enchanting Belle.One
of her career best roles.....Love you Emma Watson2)VFX: Beauty and the Beast has amazing VFX.I got a great nostalgic
feel watching the Great Castle and especially our entertaining talking
clock Cogsworth ,candelabra Lumiere,kettle Mrs.Potts and her son
Chip,everything is sol lively and lovely.And last but not least our
terrifying Beast.He is so charming despite of his beastly look.3)Music: It&#x27;s the music that makes it particularly special, and
appreciating that is entirely the point of the live-action remake. It&#x27;s
hard to imagine a case for this film&#x27;s existence without the songs &#x96;
without, say, that five-note &#x22;Tale as Old as Time&#x22; motif,foot tapping
Gaston,visual wonder &#x22; Be our Guest&#x22; and many more..Even though they
used all the tracks from the original,they still felt lovely.4)Direction: Bill Condon did a marvelous job by bringing the best live
screen adaptation of the classic.Bill Condon&#x27;s direction and Tobias
Schliessler&#x27;s cinematography must be applauded, especially for making
this fairy tale enjoyable for people of all ages.5)Art and Costumes: Definitely deserves a nomination for Oscars..Such a
lovely settings and costumes..Emma looked gorgeous in the yellow gown
in the ballroom scene.6)3D: This has one of the best 3D for a Disney film.It has brilliant
pop out effects when the Beast throws a snowball at Belle,Sorry! at
audience and when the Chip throws the saucers at the intruders,Sorry!
again right at the audience and there are lot of such moments..But
disappointed a bit regarding the in screen depth.So,Beauty and the Beast is the perfect live action adaptation of
classic with Emma Watson&#x27;s flawless portrayal of Belle,splendid VFX
,foot tapping music and charming screenplay..A Must watch for allMy rating 10/10
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Go if you want to relive your childhood<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I finally had to change to go back to my childhood with this one. Many complain the CGI doesn&#x27;t look realistic. Well how much more
realistic do you want a teacup to look?I avoided spoilers these last weeks, besides Evans and Watson I did not
know who else was playing and what a surprise I got. Recently went to
see T2 Trainspotting where McGregor was amazing. So seeing him in this
one weee hoo. McGregor with a French accent does not disappoint one
bit.Still don&#x27;t get why it was banned in some parts of the world because of
the gay moments. Gad stole the show on so many occasions and made the
character so likable.I for one loved the movie. I felt an emotional connection with the
story. It may have been because of it being my first animated movie
when I was a kid, it may have been the great acting or the 3D
experience. The thing is, I enjoyed it and I definitely recommend it to all those
that want to relive a little bit their childhood.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Amazing!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I thought the movie was very well done. I agree, Gaston was my
favorite. He did a great job. As for the gay under tone.....whatever!
Most movies have it. It was so subtle you really had to look for it.
Similar to but less than Sweet Home Alabama. Think about this...if Olaf
wasn&#x27;t a snowman in Frozen it would have been the same here. No big
deal! Emma Watson was a fantastic choice for Belle. I thought it
impossible to break the Hermione character and she impressed me!! The
perfect Belle!! The only bad I can say....Beasts solo??? There was a
point but eh???? I didn&#x27;t care for it. Some graphics in later scenes
looked fake and that is the only bad I can say!! Loved this movie and
going back Sunday to see it again!!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Wonderful! Spectacular! Awesome!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I also agree that we should IGNORE all these Opening Negative Reviews!They were placed at the very beginning by folks that didn&#x27;t even see
this Great Movie!For the entire 2 hours and nine minutes my film audience was taken in
by this wonderful fairy tale!This 2017 Beauty and the Beast is a Winner! Emma Watson, Kevin Kline, and Dan Stevens were Superb !
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Where the H*** are all these negative reviews coming from?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was literally expecting to come on here to see at least an 8/10 and
more positive comments but I&#x27;m not surprised because many people on
here do have the tendency to bash great movies. BUT WOW, Disney went
above &#x26; beyond for this movie. At first, even I was skeptical about
Emma playing Belle, I&#x27;m so used to her being Hermione but she played
the part perfectly. It was Magical, wonderful, the effects and details
were more specific, antique yet &#x22;royal&#x22; looking. It reminded me so much
of the original film yet much BETTER. This is one movie I&#x27;m definitely
going back to the theaters to watch again soon. But please, if you&#x27;re a
complicated person, please do not go watch the movie knowing very well
you&#x27;re going to come back on here just to make the ratings lower. I see
people complaining that is was too much like the original and others
saying it wasn&#x27;t enough like the older version. None of them will ever
be pleased, not even with an 160 million$ budget. Disney, it was
AMAZING and I definitely can&#x27;t wait for our Florida trip next weekend
to visit the Be Our Guest Restaurant. I never do movie reviews but for
this movie, well it definitely seems like it needs more positive people
on here. If you&#x27;re a big beauty and the beast fan and aren&#x27;t miserable,
this is a must watch for you.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Exquisite Adaptation<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney really got one right in this case. The artistry is beautiful,
the acting and casting is impeccable, and Disney was able to hit the
important social lessons with just the right balance without being
heavy-handed. It does the original animated film justice while adding
more dimension to the story and further fleshing out the characters,
ultimately without changing important details of the original. The
music was also handled perfectly, adding new songs with the same flavor
as the original while not remixing the original songs into awful
parodies of themselves. This is the only film I have ever attended that
got two rounds of applause after it ended. It is worth seeing on its
own merit, and is also a fun nostalgic walk down memory lane for those
of us who were young when the original came out (and the movie knows
it, and gives more than a couple subtle nods to this).
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Beauty of a Film<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is a wondrous film that can never be
touched...well...unless Disney is the one doing the refurbishments.
This classic &#x22;tale as old as time&#x22; was brilliantly reimagined with all
of the same pomp and circumstance as the original. The production
design and costuming perfectly captured the dark ominous moods while
simultaneously highlighting the sheer elegance of the picture. A piece
of this elegance was brought about by the film&#x27;s effervescent and at
times, gripping score provided by the composer of the original film&#x27;s
score, Alan Menken. The familiarity of the film in its score and story
was astonishing and probably the only thing I could see anybody having
a grievance about. However, the picture did provide some much needed
backstory that was glossed over in the 1991 version of the film. With
that, Disney did a commendable job at adapting several aspects of the
story while still maintaining the nostalgia for the film we all know
and love. Finally, I must mention that the casting for this film was
phenomenal. With Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Ian McKellen and Ewan
McGregor as Cogsworth and Lumi&#xE8;re, Dan Stevens as Beast, and Emma
Watson as Belle, the talent was truly immeasurable. I know that some
fans of the beloved animated film were a bit skeptical of Emma Watson
in the role of Belle as she had no musical theatre experience prior to
playing this cherished Disney Princess. Nevertheless, I can assure
those fans that she did an outstanding job as Belle. While Watson&#x27;s
vocals did seem a bit fine-tuned, she still managed to bring a higher
level of emotion and meaning to Belle&#x27;s voice. She boldly characterized
the true meaning of feminism all while subtly hinting at Belle&#x27;s
down-to-earth nature. With that, I must say that this film was, without
a doubt, transcendent of our modern era. The picture gave life to a new
generation of family entertainment, yet it still managed to charm us
with its nostalgic vibes. For me, this film lived up to the glory of
its predecessor and may have even surpassed it. From now on, when I
think of the story of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast,&#x22; I will think of this
enchanting masterpiece.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Excellent Film and Must See!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Don&#x27;t be discouraged by what other people have said about this movie
being bad. If you want to see exactly the original film, then by all
means, do not watch this movie. However, if you want to see a story
that is close to the original but added a little more layers, some
tweaks every now and then, of course then, I highly recommend this
movie. Some people spoke about the CGI on the beast, but I still think
they did an overall fantastic job and it didn&#x27;t bother me one bit. I
love Emma Watson. Her acting towards the end got kind of iffy, but she
did her part adequately. Dan Stevens is just as charming as ever,
especially as the beast. Luke Evans takes the cake for acting as Gaston
but BEING Gaston, which made me think the role was best suited for him.
I love this adaptation and I will definitely see it again.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It&#x27;s was better than i was expected<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
At first i was very skeptical about the movie because all of the
reviews but after I saw the movie I must say that I&#x27;m impressed. It was
beautifully made and i can&#x27;t think other person that can fit belle
other than Emma Watson. If you like the original you must see this one
because It&#x27;s very good and it even better than original, in my opinion.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Animated movie flawlessly incarnated on the big screen!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First of all I want to say that the Beauty and the beast is one of my
favorite Disney animated movies and I don&#x27;t know how many times I have
watched it as a kid.So, that being said, I may sound a little bias when I say that it is
the best Disney animated movie adaptation I have ever seen! This is the
animated movie flawlessly incarnated on the big screen.-Both stage and voice acting was good. Emma and Luke did a good job of
leading heroine and villain. I also really enjoyed Ewan McGregor&#x27;s
Lumi&#xE8;re.-Art director and designers did an amazing job of masterfully bringing
the animated world to life.-And what Choreographers did was incredible! Those dance and song
scenes, combined with the set design... I am lost for words!-Pacing and story is exactly as it was in the original animated movie,
with a couple of new scenes where director took the liberty of saying a
few words of his own, to leave his mark. But nothing much that would
affect the main story, on the contrary it adds to it.-Lots of people complained about cgi, but believe me it is NOT bad.
Sure there were couple of iffy moments, but overall it was done
beautifully. I&#x27;d prefer cgi Beast to Edward 2.0 and Edward 3.0 any day!I apologize if the review is so overly positive, but I couldn&#x27;t help
myself when I loved every moment of it. So here is the bottom line, If
you loved the Disney animated movie, I guarantee you&#x27;re gonna love
this, because it is basically the same, the story, the songs, the
characters... Everything! The only difference you&#x27;ll see is that it
looks more real. I basically sat though the whole movie with a dumb
smile on my face. If you haven&#x27;t seen the animated movie before, you&#x27;ll
&#x27;probably&#x27; still gonna love it, as one of my friends who didn&#x27;t know
about it, really loved it! and if for some reason you didn&#x27;t like the
original, i don&#x27;t know, you&#x27;ll probably still not gonna like it..?Anyway, If people do say bad stuff about it do not listen, just go and
see for yourself, you won&#x27;t regret it!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>MAGICAL. Don&#x27;t believe otherwise.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Not to quote a certain overcooked potato, but anyone rating this movie
less than 8/10 is fake news. I grew up loving Beauty and the Beast, and
sitting in that theater at 27, this version was one of the most amazing
movie-going experiences I&#x27;ve ever had. Exceptional cast, more
fleshed-out than the original while still staying true to the story,
and even more magical. I couldn&#x27;t look away the whole time. It really
felt like being a kid again and seeing it for the first time with just
the right amount of nostalgia, humor, and action. I teared up at least
a dozen times and was in full-on tears by the end. It was perfect. I
will probably watch it in theaters again, will definitely buy it when
it&#x27;s on bluray. See it in theaters if you can. Immersive and beautiful.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Stunning movie, I was ecstatic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
What a wonderful, charming film, we see the same story, but in a
totally charming way. I saw and I was dazzled, I remembered the story
of drawing of Disney and it seemed magic the scenarios are something of
very refinement and show of effects !!!Well, I loved everything, scenarios, musics and performances, I found
it exciting this movie that we know the color story, but that came with
new clothes, and it was wonderful! Congratulations to beautiful Emma
Watson, could not be another actress, she really is Bela, she is
beautiful too !!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Even Better Than I Imagined!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Very well done. I am surprised by some of the reviews on here knocking
this film. It kept the spirit of the original but added some back story
so we got to know the characters even better! The music was incredible.
There is nothing bad to say about this film except it was pretty long
BUT there were about 100 kids in the theater and I didn&#x27;t hear one
single child the entire move so you know it had to have been good to
keep the little ones&#x27; attention the entire time.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>What a major masterpiece!!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Just left the theater. I have to say that the movie was an absolute
masterpiece!! I am an absolute die-hard beauty and the beast fan. The
movie was so amazing, it had you laughing, crying, and falling in love
the whole time! I definitely thought it wouldn&#x27;t hold a candle to my
beloved classic but it definitely surprised me! I couldn&#x27;t be any
happier with how it turned out! It gave my all time favorite fairy tale
the ultimate justice it deserves! It went above and beyond my
expectations! Absolutely fabulous! I can&#x27;t wait to watch it again!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Exceptional!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;m quite surprised that Beauty and the Beast didn&#x27;t receive higher
rates. I just left the cinema, and remembered exactly why I used to
love Disney so much as a kid, and why I still love them! Everything
about this movie is so MAGICAL. I loved how they created the beast,
sang the songs, acting, Emma Watson is truly a natural beauty and
perfect for the role! 10 out 10!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Finally a Disney remake that is worthy of Disney<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I must confess that I am a huge Disney fan. I love the movies, well
most of them. I love visiting Disneyland regardless of whether its
Paris or Florida (Can&#x27;t comment on the others as I haven&#x27;t been to them
but I imagine that they are magical too). But one thing that I have
been critical of with Disney in recent years. Is the lack of
imagination. Disney seem insistent on ruining the memories of my childhood by
remaking all of their animated classics in to &#x22;real world&#x22; movies. With
the exception of Maleficent which gave the tale of Sleeping Beauty a
new twist, I have been bitterly disappointed with the remakes. This was
topped by the appalling Jungle Book. Yet I was excited about the remake of Beauty and the Beast, while also
extremely apprehensive. The original is a classic and all of the hype
surrounding this film couldn&#x27;t make me help but feel 2 things. First
that I might be in danger of seeing the film in the trailers that when
it gets to the movie that I will have seen it. The second was too many
details were being released regarding it, such as it having a gay
character and the first interracial kiss. Why should these things make
headlines? However I went into the movie still excited about what
Disney had done with it.I watched the movie in 3D and there was a few things that came out of
the screen but seeing it in 2D wouldn&#x27;t have changed the viewing
pleasure. What Disney have done with this film, is set the bar so high for future
remakes, that I don&#x27;t think they will beat it. They treated the
original respect, yet brought this movie up to date. The new songs that
were introduced were beautiful and &#x22;Evermore&#x22; brought me to tears in
the cinema. The hype surrounding around a gay character wasn&#x27;t
justified it was very subtle and tasteful that unless you was looking
out for it I am not sure you would have noticed. The story also had a few little additions but this all added to the
film rather then subtracted it. In fact I would go as far as to say
that it made the characters and the story more believable. I left the
cinema wanting to go back and see it again. This film was that good. The only criticism I would make is the sound mixing could have been
better. There was a clear difference int he sound between when the
actors were speaking and then the rerecording of their singing. The
singing wasn&#x27;t bad at all but it was slightly distracting. My concern
that Ewan McGregors annoying french accent would grate on me for the
whole film slowly disappeared as the film progressed. Must confess that
I did think Mrs Potts was played by Helana Bonham-Carter but it was in
fact played by Emma Thompson. In summary the film was everything I hoped Disney would make and lived
up to the magic that I expected. I have no problems recommending this
film and giving it 10/10
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I thought the movie was fantastic! The singing was beautiful. The sets
were big and enchanting. (The village was very similar to how I
remembered it from the animated movie.) And the costumes were lovely.
Emma Watson was absolutely darling as Belle - with her feisty and
sympathetic expressions. I loved the addition of a few scenes and
songs. I came out of the theater feeling like I&#x27;d seen the animated
film, only more magical. And that&#x27;s what I was hoping for with this
movie release!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great, but I miss 2 songs...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
A great and magical movie, but it&#x27;s a shame, that &#x22;Human Again&#x22; &#x26; &#x22;If I
Can&#x27;t Love Her&#x22; from the stage-version are not in the movie...Therefore only 9 out of 10 stars. With these 2 songs it would be 10
stars and even more, if more would be possible. But with these 2 songs
missing, I can&#x27;t give the full points.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Joy to behold<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
While I have deep respect for anyone&#x27;s honest opinion of movies, I have
to say I rarely &#x22;review&#x22; a movie for technical acumen. I think about
the only movie I&#x27;ve ever done that with was Star Trek 5 in which one of
my best friends and I felt like Siskel and Ebert at the back of the
theater picking the thing to pieces.Granted, that movie was easy to do that to. This movie was an absolute
joy to behold! I&#x27;ve heard talk of distractions etc with the Beast in
their effort to keep a touch of humanity to his otherwise inhuman face,
but I just didn&#x27;t care. It was joyous. Ewan McGreggor nearly steals the
movie as LeFluer, and Emma Watson is a delight.Probably above all, the nonsense of Lefoo (sp?) is nonsense! Yes he was
clearly gay in the movie, but I did not care one iota. Go see it, and
don&#x27;t try to judge, try to enjoy. Probably the easiest thing you&#x27;ll do.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Tales as old as time no so old i think<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First of all the movie was amazing the intro was better than I could
expect. I went very considers that this movie could not make my
expectation, but I left with much more than that. So many questions
were answer and so many things that they were add for the good of the
movie. Emma Watson and Dan Steven were great , I have no doubt that
other people would thing that they were wrong cast but they make sense
for me. The chemistry between those two was great and even one point of
the movie I kind of hate Emma Watson for leaving the beast. Also
musically speaking I would like to said that most people are expecting
beautiful voices in this movie. True , and what I heard was beautiful I
don&#x27;t care what people said about Emma and Dan couldn&#x27;t sing they sing
great and wonderful, they were themselves and that what sale the movie
for me the unique and own voice trying to make more real the tales as
old as time. Dan song Evermore deserve more than just a price deserve a
Oscar and I would be so mad if he doesn&#x27;t get at least for best song in
the track. I think they took this outside the box and that was good for
some people other would disagree because they fail in love with the
original one but this one was what they want something new that would
bring all ages to the cinema to enjoy and remember those years when
were growing up an love to watch this movie. For me this movie is great
and it would be part of my favorite movies from Disney.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beautiful, Enchanting &#x26; Fun<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
To be honest, I don&#x27;t know what everyone is complaining about. I
thought this was a fantastic live rendition of this classic of a movie.The sets were absolutely beautiful &#x26; detailed. The music was enchanting
while keeping the original score just as gorgeous as it was. They
changed just enough to make it a bit more modern but still kept it the
same, something I greatly appreciated.The acting was on point for me. I thought they did just a fine job. No
overacting, keeping to the way the characters were in the original.
Emma &#x26; Dans chemistry was perfect. Keep in mind they are meant to hate
each other at the start THEN fall in love. Which I thought they
portrayed perfectly. Still wary of each other, but still that
connection.The costumes were beautiful. Perfect for the era but not over the top
when it didn&#x27;t need to be. And pretty spot on to the original. I was
disappointed with Belles iconic ball gown dress, but also it&#x27;s a movie
&#x26; I didn&#x27;t let that one detail bother me. It was about their story, not
what they wore.The musical scores were fantastic just to sum it up in one word. They
were entertaining, classy and just plain fun. I wanted to get up and
dance &#x26; start singing along.I have NO idea what people are talking about with the &#x27;distraction&#x27; of
Beasts CGI. I mean. What? And also with the &#x27;creepy&#x27; faces of the
staff. They kept their faces to the original also. Some had the parts
to make faces whiles others didn&#x27;t and some have to have painted ones.
If people get &#x27;creeped out&#x27; or distracted&#x27; by this stuff then I don&#x27;t
know how they watch most movies now a days &#x26; need to rethink their
priorities a bit to be honest.I especially loved the backstory they included for Belles mother. It
added a bit more depth to both Belle &#x26; her father Maurice, and a bit
more believability to Belle &#x26; Beasts relationship, due to how it was
found.Beasts origin story was better also. It made his change a lot more
satisfying and you could see exactly just how much he changes; not for
just himself but for others that he loves.Also, that whole &#x27;Stockholm syndrome&#x27; crap doesn&#x27;t make its way into
this movie. I didn&#x27;t think it did in the first one to be honest.In the end I loved this movie. It was a bright, fun movie. You just
need to sit down, relax, stop thinking so hard &#x26; just enjoy. As that
what movies are for. To stop over-analyzing things for just a moment &#x26;
enjoy something. And this one I easily did.

This movie could not have been better! They stuck to the original
songs, the original plot. The casting was spot on. A perfect Belle &#x26;
Beast! Just phenomenal! The yellow dress was just fabulous. I wouldn&#x27;t
have changed a thing. It was hard not to sing along in the theater! The
acting was superb, very touching.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>SPOILER ALERT -- I&#x27;m going to talk about events in the film, don&#x27;t read if you don&#x27;t want to know<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Absolutely gorgeous! I have no complaint about the cast, the sets, or
the CGI -- it all worked for me. Among my favorite parts of the film were the little salutes to various
musicals as well as other Disney films. By my count there were salutes
to:Oliver!- Sound of Music-Singing in the Rain- Moulin RougeThe whole &#x22;Be My Guest&#x22; is a feast of Busby Berkeley routines with a
little Esther Williams thrown in. I&#x27;m hoping to see the film up for several Oscars: Cinematography, Best
Score, Costuming, Set Design, Make-up, and &#x22;Evermore&#x22; for Best Song,
although I can see either &#x22;Days in the Sun&#x22; or &#x22;How Does A Moment Last
Forever&#x22; being picked instead. I loved the film so much I&#x27;m going back to see it again...maybe more
than once. Note: This film can be very dark, I would not take a very young child
to this.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Avoid extreme expectations and keep nostalgia in check.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As hard as it was, I set my expectations on neutral before watching
this tonight. This movie is not just for the fans of the original
animated feature. It&#x27;s also for the current generation, as well as the
minority of fans loyal to the original story. This means that not all
expectations will be met for every fan.This review takes that into account.Let&#x27;s start with what works as a film:1. Character development. The characters (not just Belle and beast) are
given depth in unexpected ways that actually add on to the fairy tale
aspect of the story, as well as making them relatable. The biggest
examples are Maurice, Gaston, Mrs.Potts. Certain character trait
expansions work really well ( like Chip being extremely energetic).2. Set design.This film is beautiful and it has the Gothic architecture
to prove it. ( however, there is a dark side to this)3. musical numbers. The comments about the auto tune need to be left
aside. It&#x27;s clearly not stopping anytime soon. Now that. I&#x27;ve gotten
that out of the way, most of the numbers are AMAZING! The visuals blend
perfectly in Be Our Guest and Gast&#xF3;n is just a blast.Now, what doesn&#x27;t work1. The editing. There are beautiful sets and shots that were cut so
abruptly, it bothered me. I&#x27;m a fan of long shots and atmospheric build
ups. I wanted certain moments and architectural structures to resonate
a little longer.2. Some of the writing. There are certain scenes that don&#x27;t hold up
from the original because of added material and unique tonal shifts.
This at times does make an actor give a poor delivery or say a line
that doesn&#x27;t make sense. I think this is one of the main points that
will throw people off as I believe it will affect the perception of the
performances on camera.At the end of the day, I was smiling at the end of this picture. I
advise people to leave the nostalgia of the original masterpiece to
view a new interpretation of a classic film.

Beauty and the Beast is the fourth of the live- action Disney remakes
after Maleficent (2014), Cinderella (2015) and The Jungle Book (2016).
So far, I thought they were okay, but none of them impressed me. This
one, however, did.The original might be my favorite Disney animated movie. I&#x27;m not sure,
but definitely in the top 5. But I do have some sort of a connection
with that one and when you go analyzing it has a lot of deeper and
important messages. Like all Disney animated movies, the original was
magical and I wondered if it would translate well on live-action. The
previous three live-action remakes were alright, but they took away so
many details that made the original so great in order to make it more
realistic. But who cares about realistic in a fairy tale? Thankfully,
this one kept the magic of the original and expanded the whole story in
order to fill in some plot holes and it worked very well. I wasn&#x27;t
bored for a second. In fact, I just didn&#x27;t want it to end. I was sucked
into this beautiful, magical story and to this day I can&#x27;t stop
thinking about it. Especially since this story is so relate-able to me
(I relate to Belle so, so much and I&#x27;m probably not the only one). I
just got sucked into the magic and I never let it go. And the musical
numbers only added fuel to the magic.The actors really got into their roles. I was really happy to see Emma
Watson in this role since she&#x27;s pretty much the heroine of my childhood
(I grew up with Harry Potter) and I think she did a really good job.
Dan Stevens is also very good as Beast and I liked how they gave him a
sarcastic side. But the one who truly steals the spotlight is Luke
Evans as the main villain Gaston. He&#x27;s disgusting and fabulous at the
same time and I&#x27;m sure they couldn&#x27;t cast a better actor for that role.
Everyone is so into it, and it&#x27;s wonderful to finally see that much
heart put into a movie. CGI might not always be believable but that
doesn&#x27;t make the movie any less gorgeous. The story is well expanded.
They kept to the story of the original while adding something new to
it.All in all, I absolutely adore this movie and I&#x27;d even say that it&#x27;s
better than the original. There were a few times that I was close to
tears of joy and I left with a big, big smile on my face. I will
definitely be coming back to this one over and over again and I
recommend this to everyone. I haven&#x27;t felt this much magic in a movie
since Harry Potter ended.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Beauty and the Beast 2017 movie review<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
*WARNING slight spoilers* I think that Beauty and the Beast is one of the best possible movies
out there for ages. Entertaining, captivating, creative . . . What
possible reason is there for disliking in this enchanting and inspiring
movie? It is appropriate for children who are 8+ as there is a scene
where an old man is bound in ropes, one of a pack of snarling wolves
attempting to kill belle, the beast, and her father, a flashback of
Belle&#x27;s mother dying of a disease, and the beast getting scratched by
the wolves, plus a few scenes of 3 couples kissing. But really? The
movie is much better that the original I give it double thumbs up!! You
should definitely watch it!!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>&#x22;How does a moment last forever?&#x22;<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Of that I can remember, no movie has pulled my heart strings so much as
Beauty and the Beast did... The drama, the suspense... truly a
wonderful production. The music score and songs were fantastic and
perfectly conveyed the tone of each scene perfectly. The &#x22;Beast&#x22; was
amazingly animated and was probably my favorite character because you
could actually feel the transformation of his feelingsDo yourself a favor and GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>well done<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I had seen the animated Beauty and the Beast as a kid and I was very
happy with how this version turned out. The characters were great
(especially LeFou, Lumiere and Mrs. Pots), the set and clothing
interesting and beautiful, and the songs were fun and catchy. I really
liked the part when the villagers are fighting the furniture of the
castle and Madame Garderobe wrapped up the three men in dresses,
makeup, and fancy hair. Two of the men were terrified while one had a
big smile on his face, I thought it was really cute.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Musical Magic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
For starters, one can never go in, expecting the level of perfection
the original had. In 1991 we were given heaven in the shape of some of
the most magical lyrics written&#x200B; anywhere. The animation wasn&#x27;t
spectacular, but the film was special and had plenty of soul. It was a
great picture. The newest entry has new songs, which are decent but
nowhere near as spectacular as the original score. However, the new
entry does really well in most instances.The new cast shines providing much of the reality and magic to the
living furniture. They, after all, are human. Emma Thompson is strong
and sweet. The rest of the cast does a decent job. And there is Belle
who in spite of not being a professional singer manages to handle the
songs nicely. No superb singing, but she&#x27;s not a singer, she&#x27;s
alternate misfit. Unlike recent musicals, this is one is touching and
fill of memorable and deep interpretations. There&#x27;s plenty to him along
even in the new songs.I like what they added to the story. Tiny bits that give you some
insight about many of the main characters. The prince is not just a
beast, but a product of his upbringing. Belle is more complicated and
with much going on in her heart and mind.The musical adaptation is fantastic. The village opening number will
leave breathless and the people behind the art direction, sets, and
costumes deserve the highest praise. Gowns look glorious and the sets
made me believe we were in the middle of an opulent setting. Great job.Simply, adaptation great films is problematic from the start, yet no
misfires here. Condon tops his precious musical entries and manages to
keep that soul intact, making us believe in an intelligent romance.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A true live action masterpiece<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
First time reviewer here but I have to do this because I feel nearly
majority of the reviews here are stupid and crazy. Going into this
movie I was so excited and I loved the animated film but the trailers
had me sold and the cast was perfect!! The songs were perfect and even
the two new songs fitted beautifully with the others and captured the
story line perfectly. I defy anyone to not shed a tears in any part of
this movie. The combination of the score, the emotions and the
characters we love so dearly made this movie beautiful. Tonight, I saw
the movie for my fourth time and I saw the sing along version and sang
along to EVERY song and was captivated in the movie all over again.
Emma Watson and Dan Stevens are brilliantly cast as Belle and the Beast
{sorry but this Beast made me feel more for him here than in the
animated movie} Casting Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson and
the others was perfect. and Luke Evans and Josh Gad - wow, Luke Evans
can sing. Please do not go off the reviews here and see the movie for
yourself. I have had many friends agree with me about the movie and
even say a second time is worth it. Yes the animated movie is iconic
and stunning but for me, this version over takes it and it now goes
this movie then the animated movie and that is saying something. Other
Disney Live actions have been amazing but this one takes the cake
Ignore all the negative reactions and see this movie
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Spectacular  tale as old as time is Beautiful Done<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
i was so excited see this movie loved Disney classic as kid i went on
opening night while this is movie is not present like original movie me
sister my brother all thought was really good Emma Watson was perfect
belle who Empower Character who takes her father place after pick white
rose for belle his daughter but is caught by Beast she soon realized
that beast is not all that bad the songs are Spectacular be our guest
scene was amazing and evermore song and days in the sun was very
emotional Luke evans as gaston was well done he was not very like
character but very much like original in end when gaston shoots beast
with his gun when he dies is very emotional Emma Watson did fantastic
job with scene there is gay scenes it is for comedy you should
definitely go watch this movie
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Wow! Great movie!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I was very skeptical about seeing this film, not because of anything in
particular, but because I felt as though everyone was hyping it up
because Emma Watson was playing Belle. But, I have to say it was a
phenomenal movie! I felt as though I was watching it for the first time
as a child all over again. I knew exactly what happens yet I was on the
edge of my seat. Emma played a beautiful and strong Belle and she sang
beautifully as well, she has a lovely voice. I was very impressed with
all the characters given tat most of them were pretty much animated.
They really brought these characters to life, amazing movie!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>**RARE and BEAUTIFUL**   A truly remarkable homage to the classic and incredibly moving<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
One of the best Disney remakes to come along in the last decade. The
effects were astonishingly light and shadow accurate. Emma Watson is an
absolute miracle and makes the music come alive with her great voice
and range. Blew my mind to read some of her performances were recorded
LIVE and kept in the film. The beast was animated perfectly and his
emotions and reactions captured perfectly for every moment. Brilliant
cast, production, effects, and music. Everything a masterpiece should
be plus a few new pieces of classic music additions. Disney has nailed
this one in every sense of the word with heart driven effects detail
worthy on a lord of the rings level. Cinematic greatness that doesn&#x27;t
work very often.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>This movie lived up to every expectation<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Bonjour, Hello! I have been waiting 2 years to see this film and I am
happy to say it was worth it. I will admit though the first 15 minutes
are a little slow but after that, every minute is amazingly
entertaining and hilarious. The blend between the original and the new
film works perfectly to create a new Disney classic, there&#x27;s a reason
why it&#x27;s the film with the highest opening weekend ever in March. Emma
Watson also does a perfect job at playing Belle capturing the true
nature of her character. Overall this is a fun filled film for the
whole family, it&#x27;s a must see.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A truly amazing version of a true classic<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I loved this movie. A beautiful movie made with love. You could really
see the hard work of the whole movie team. I really liked that you got some more backstory of both The Prince/The
Beast and of Belle/The Beauty and also how no one never noticed it was
a castle near by the village.Luke Evans was perfect as Gaston and I really liked Josh Gads take of
Lefou. Really liked how it felt nostalgic and familiar all through the movie,
but also with some new content.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Simply Amazing<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This film is great in almost all aspects. Visually, musically,
performance-wise, etc. This truly is a remarkable film. The acting is
fantastic, the fact they sang the songs from the original 1991 film
just shows how dedicated the people involved with this film is. And the
songs are beautifully sung and produced. As well as the setup, and CGI
of the household characters in the castle. And the story is absolutely
fantastic and well shown in this film. I recommend this film to anyone
who&#x27;s seen the original from 1991, as well as everyone else, as it&#x27;s
not only beautifully produced and acted, but it&#x27;s also a great story
that is shown in a simply amazing way. I was pleasantly surprised, and
I think anyone who sees this film for the first time will be too.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>99% in love<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Beauty and the Beast was better 100 times better than I thought it
would be. The score was fantastic, the plot holes were filled, the cgi
was amazing, and every moment of the movie was enjoyable. To me this
movie represents everything that a movie- musical should be.The only downside was the music directors auto tuned Emma a bit to much
and made parts of her songs sound digital.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Everything you could expect and more<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie does the most amazing job at bringing the classic animated
Disney film to life. As a huge fan of the movie growing up, I had a lot
of expectations about this movie, and some worries as well, but after I
saw it, the only thing I could think about was the next time I would be
able to see it. It is absolute perfection, there is so much magic and
thought put into this, each actor was chosen and became the character.
Emma Watson makes young girls look up to a beautiful princess who has
ambitions, and dreams, who wants to be more than what people want her
to be. This movie shows people that love isn&#x27;t just about looks, yes
the original did that as well, but this makes it seem more real, it
shows the progression of the characters and with some adjustments to
the songs and lines, truly lets the watchers feel the emotions and
understand what it is like for each character. This movie never ceases
to make me uncontrollably happy, well done Disney.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>What&#x27;s with all the negativity - this is classic Disney!!!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I really don&#x27;t understand all the negativity being aimed at this film.
For me, this was Disney at it&#x27;s best - whisking me away with great
story, memorable tunes and that Disney magic.Both my boyfriend and I left the cinema with huge grins and buzzing
about what we had just seen - it took me back to my childhood when the
only way to see Disney films was at the cinema and I revisited the
magic I used to feel walking out after seeing The Jungle Book amongst
others.Be Our Guest is an amazing spectacle, the musical numbers are
extravagant and I loved the extra plot included throughout the film -
for me made it a more rounded story. If I was picky, I was expecting
Beast to be a bit bigger and more intimidating, but that may have
scared the younger audience.If you want an exact replica of the animation, then you will be
disappointed. But if you are after a film where you can lose yourself
for just over 2 hours, get fully wrapped up in a classic story and both
laugh and cry, then this is it. I loved the subtle humour. Well worth
seeing in 3D and will be a definite purchase when eventually released
on Blu-ray.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney&#x27;s got it&#x27;s magic back<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I do understand the other critics, especially the &#x27;bad&#x27; CGI comments,
but I wanted to provide another perspective on this for you.Cultural context: Yes, this movie requires you to see the original -
but if you are open to a new approach and a deeper story, you might
never wanna go back to the original again after you&#x27;ve seen this movie.The story is enhanced in almost every aspect: Plot holes have been
closed, motivations and a lot of background are added for all relevant
characters. The casting is superb in every detail, the acting is
emotive. The direction takes a lot more time to explore feelings than
the original did.Among the deeper story elements - without giving anything away - is an
enhanced role for the enchantress. By not knowing how much she is
involved, events seem less coincidental and more - well, enchanted. It
adds the kind of literal magic the original movie lacked. Just an
example: Does the tree really fall by accident or is there something
else involved?Here is also where the CGI adds in. Yes, there are some problems with
it: Sometimes you can tell that Emma Watson had no one to play to on
set, sometimes the backgrounds look not well keyed out. And the beast
as well as the wolves, is close to the uncanny valley. BUT I think this
is one of the movies strong suits: You can never really focus on the
beast, never really grasp it - just like it should be if you are
involved in the story. If it would have been rendered more plastic, it
could have looked flat and so real you loose empathy. With the wolves I
almost felt they would be transformed humans as well.So in my opinion, the CGI just adds to illustrate the story.The new songs by Alan Menken are amazing, the auto-tune and editing on
the singing is hidden well (except for the beginning) and the
orchestration is much more subtle and dynamic than the original. Going
back for Menken and Rice to work on this for the third time in their
lives has payed off.I&#x27;d advise you to - if you are going to see the movie for yourself -
keep an open mind and remember the sense of wonder you could feel as a
child. Because if you let this happen, you will be enchanted as well.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Walt would be &#x22;OH&#x22; so very proud of this live version...so where is all this hate coming from?<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As any parent should be proud of their children so is father Maurice
(Kevin Kline) of his only child, his daughter Belle (Emma Watson) who
could never imagine herself swooning over the town&#x27;s handsome and
one-dimensional Ox named Gaston who was played by Luke Evans quite
well. Gaston is really in love with himself and he realizes if he wants
to have little Gaston&#x27;s to continue bearing his name then he wants to
marry the smartest, prettiest and the only woman in the town who he
just cannot convince to marry him, and that young lady happens to be
Belle.I am not a big fan of musicals and as an example I was most displeased
to have to sit through the 2014 Disney live version of Into the Woods.
Once Emma Watson commenced singing her opening song Ms. Shullivan
grabbed my arm just a little bit tighter and I just knew this was going
to be another Disney classic...and it is!There are so many first class performers in this film such as Ewan
McGregor who plays Luminere the candelabra, Ian McKellan who plays
Cogsworth the mantle clock, the classy Emma Thompson who is no stranger
to appearing in Disney films so she plays Mrs. Potts and by default
Belle&#x27;s conscience while she resides in the Beast&#x27;s castle. Other great
performances were on display by Audra McDonald who plays Madame
Garderobe, and I cannot forget Stanley Tucci who plays Maestro Cadenza
and of course Gaston&#x27;s flunky sidekick the gay LeFou played perfectly
by Josh Gad.Some countries apparently are uncomfortable with LeFou being a bit more
interested in Gaston than he should be but let&#x27;s face it, this is the
year 2017, and so any film should embrace actors/actresses that reflect
today&#x27;s society. In fact if I would have been asked for my opinion by
the producers for any suggestions, without hesitation although I truly
believe the six (6) foot Luke Evans performance as Gaston was
excellent, I would have suggested an alternate name to play Gaston. Or
at least give the six (6) foot four (4) inch retired NFL Hall of Fame
defensive end, the gap tooth super handsome Michael Strahan to be
provided an opportunity to test for the role of Gaston. Strahan would
have been great and he would also have allowed a new generation of
young children to see that Disney films have evolved to be inclusive
when selecting starring roles.Okay so for those naysayers who want to compare this version of Beauty
and the Beast to earlier versions, and compare actual Disney
characters, or actors/actresses, or the songs style and/or the singers
who sing them, I suggest you just close your eyes and please just try
to imagine yourself as a very younger version of your own self. If you
do this and then fast forward to your adult self you will wake up to
see that we are in the year 2017, and that good producers attempt to be
more inclusive if the story allows for it and in most cases Disney
films such as this great Disney Classic, Beauty and the Beast does. So
I loved seeing the diversity in the ballroom scene, I loved Emma Watson
and Luke Wilson&#x27;s gradual affection for each other, I loved Josh Gad&#x27;s
closing scene where he finds his mate, and although I am still not
convinced that CGI is an essential part, or for that matter 3-D film
versions when I see the younger crowd mesmerized by this film, then I
can accept it...and maybe some of you naysayers should be a bit more
open minded.I know this live version of Beauty and the Beast will do extremely well
at both the box office and when it is eventually released in the retail
stores on DVD/Blu Ray format, or streaming one day on NetFlix, or some
other new format, such as when humans eventually live on another
planet. Walt Disney himself had this kind of endless imagination where
others did not and I just know he would have been very proud of all the
performances of this cast, the cinematography and of course the musical
score.FOOTNOTE: Mrs. Shullivan and I did like the 1991 animated version, but
we are in agreement on this next point...we enjoyed this 2017 live
version a lot more!!!I rate this Disney Classic a perfect 10 out of 10. It is definitely a
keeper.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It...is....AWESOME!!!<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Just watched the film and it was amazing. I love the cast, the updated
story, and of course, the songs.Emma Watson was absolute perfection as Belle, and she can sing. Dan
Stevens rocks it as the Beast, and he can sing surprisingly good, just
like Emma Watson. The entire cast was excellent as well, including Luke
Evans and Josh Gad.Be Our Guest was one of my highlights of the film. The choreography in
the song was stunning. I loved every second of it.I personally think this film is even better than the original. No
offense to the original film. I loved every second of it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>What a wonderful musical<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Seems nobody likes fun anymore, because you couldn&#x27;t have made this
film any better. The 1946 version is amazing and so is this live action
retelling, with a rearranged score by Alan Menken and new songs. The
cast completely knocks it out of the park. Emma Watson&#x27;s Belle is
enchanting and it turns out she has an outstanding singing voice. The
supporting cast is enthralling especially Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh
Gad as LeFou. Dan Steven&#x27;s brings the Beast to life and the story-line
and progression of him and Belle is even better than the cartoon. More
emotional, more realistic and yet this film is just as if not more
magical. Visually it is grand and the costumes and set design make you
feel inside a fantasy world. All the hatred clearly are from people who
didn&#x27;t want to even see this film in the first place. Bill Condon,
screenwriter of Chicago and director of Dreamgirls, directs a massively
entertaining spectacle, this is the Disney live action musical everyone
has been waiting for. Especially Disney, who wanted to make a live
action version decades ago. Forget La La Land, this is a musical with a
classically sounding cast.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Tale as old as time<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Well, who doesn&#x27;t like the Disney classic of 1991? I know, many might
think, why do we need to watch another live action remake of a Disney
classic? Well, because they know that we&#x27;ll go to the cinema to watch
it, as Disney has been proved right in the last year with: &#x22;Alice in
Wonderland&#x22;, &#x22;Maleficient&#x22;, &#x22;Cinderella&#x22;, &#x22;The Jungle Book&#x22;, and it&#x27;s
only a matter of time before we have: &#x22;The Little Mermaid&#x22;, &#x22;The Lion
King&#x22; or &#x22;Aladdin&#x22; on the big screen with real actors. So if Marvel is
a non-stop machine of superhero movies making, this more classical side
of Disney is a non-stop machine of cartoon classic movies.So, the movie is interesting to watch; because of course you will
wonder: have they changed the story? Are the dialogues the same? What
do the characters look like (in case you are of that minority who
hasn&#x27;t watched any advertising at all). And best of all: how is
Hermione, er Emma Watson, playing Belle? So, the movie is not bad, but
maybe is not that good, but as said before, is interesting to watch and
enjoyable. Maybe a bit too long, and there are many added situations
and details that try to give an added value compared to the 19991&#x27;s one
but honestly, it could have worked without it. There is one real problem here: that the classic movie from 1991 was
too good, too good, so anything that is being made will be compared no
matter what, and if we do compare this one, sorry, but it loses. If the
cartoon one didn&#x27;t exist at all, then maybe our opinions would differ.
The plot is exactly the same. Except some updated facts: more feminism,
black characters, and even a gay one, which by the way, it&#x27;s probably
the funniest thing of the movie. Then another trouble is that making
CGI characters leaves less flexibility than designing it as a cartoon,
and that is why all household characters look a bit weird at the
beginning, but you&#x27;ll get used to it pretty fast. Then there are the
human actors. Emma Watson nails it as Belle, giving her a Hermione
touch of course, that will make Potterheads crazier. Opposite her is
Dan Stevens who is most of the movie behind the beast face but his
voice is enough for us to love the characters. But leaving the main
couple aside, there is another couple that in my opinion steals the
show; and those are Gaston and LeFou, which a probably the best
characters in this adaptation. Gaston playing a narcissist and LeFou
playing the unwanted lover, which is really hilarious and a breath of
fresh air.Last but not least, we have the other main character of the movie: the
music. Just listening to the first opening tunes gives us goosebumps
that we&#x27;ll reappear at other points of the movie when we listen to the
songs we were waiting for, special &#x22;Tale as old as time...&#x22;. Plus there
are three extra songs that weren&#x27;t in the cartoon movie that will
probably surprise us too. A movie about a tale that we all know about. It might be too long at
some point, but nonetheless it&#x27;s a movie to enjoy with the whole
family. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you were a kid when you watched the
original one or a parent of said kit, the tales is the same, what only
changes is the way it is told. Just remember, when you get out of the
cinema, you&#x27;ll only want to watch the cartoon one and be five years old
again.#BeOurGuest
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>A Satisfying Remake<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Disney&#x27;s highly anticipated remake of the &#x27;tale as old as time&#x27; has
arrived, and while not perfect, it certainly packs in cutting-edge
special effects and extravagance that can please audiences of all ages.
The film&#x27;s plot is very similar to that of the original version.
However, the CGI effects are often very realistic. There are, however,
some exceptions, as the character designs of the Beast and some of the
&#x27;object&#x27; characters (such as Cogsworth and Lumiere) could have been
done better. That said, from its lavish set pieces to realistic-looking
CGI wolves, the film overall is visually enthralling.The music in the film is excellent, and the scenes where such music can
be found are choreographed perfectly. &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22; and the climatic
action scene where Gaston&#x27;s mob storms the castle are easily the two
best scenes in the movie. The performances are slightly hit-or-miss,
however. The acting could have been slightly improved, as Emma Watson
gives a solid but unspectacular performance as Belle. Still, however,
Disney does a very good job overall of adapting this story for modern
audiences using live action and delivers an entertaining end result.
Recommended. 7/10
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Great, but could have used some more work.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I thought this movie was very good. The musical numbers like &#x22;Be Our
Guest&#x22; and &#x22;Gaston&#x22; are very nostalgic. I had 3 main issues with the
film, though. 1. The CGI was not very well done. The Beast&#x27;s face was a
constant distraction and the wolves were poorly done. 2. Luke Evans
played a great Gaston, but I didn&#x27;t find him manly enough. &#x22;Not a bit
of him&#x27;s scraggly or scrawny&#x22; didn&#x27;t really fit him. And 3. Josh Gad&#x27;s
LeFou seemed too gay. At many points, I found myself thinking &#x22;Was that
really necessary?&#x22; The dancing at the end of the movie was okay, but
during the &#x22;Gaston&#x22; song, it was not very subtle.

The first thing you need to understand is that, according to some
scholars, every story is at its essence a love story. Even, for
example, some the male-oriented actioners can be perceived as a tale
where the hero is in love ... with himself.Second, the original Belle Et La Bete is an 18th century French tale
with antecedents, they say, in older literature going back 4000 years.
(Wikipedia) Since it is a French tale, it is only fitting that the
French were the first to film it, in the 1940s, with Cocteau at the
helm. One of my all time favorite films.Now to the Disney machine. Disney has done this story before. Disney,
being Disney, simply cannot resist the temptation to set the story to
music. Seriously. If there is a third world war, and 100 years from
now, Disney does a film about that, it will no doubt be a musical too.The story was changed significantly. Add the musical interludes and you
are really dealing with a variant or &#x22;fork&#x22; of the tale but not the
real one. It is significant that even the critics who love the film
cannot help but notice that chunks of it are &#x22;awkward.&#x22; Watson is a
delight. Can never tire of seeing her light up the screen. The movie
however is deeply flawed, and odd.See the French original. Or see the Kristin Kruek TV knockoff. Both
are, overall, better and more focused productions.

For a typical girl like me who&#x27;s a hopeless romantic, the movie is
absolutely &#x22;amazing&#x22;. It is literally a come-to-life version of the
legendary animated film. Despite the other reviews, all of the actors&#x27;
acting wasn&#x27;t that bad, although I must say it&#x27;s short of superb, they
could have done better.On the low side, I didn&#x27;t like Belle&#x27;s yellow dress, (not that my
opinion matters haha) but, the one in the animated film looked better,
Emma&#x27;s looked like a layers of cake, in my opinion, she could&#x27;ve worn
like a real ball gown that swings with every turn, and that scatters
glitters, haha.Overall, the movie&#x27;s special effects, voice over and overall impact is
beautiful. xoxo

If you&#x27;ve seen the 1991 animated classic, that experience will almost
certainly cloud your initial viewing of this live action version. The
first time I saw the new Beauty and the Beast (Thursday night), I
thought it was good to very good. When I saw it again this morning
(Sunday), it was spectacular. I was able to free myself from inevitable
comparisons and could just enjoy this movie on its own. And it really
is special. The back stories on Maurice, Belle and the Beast added to
the richness of the story and fleshed out their characters in a very
meaningful way. The new songs also added depth. Emma Watson&#x27;s singing
voice was better than I expected although not a strong, Broadway show
capability. Dan Stevens, on the other hand, has a surprisingly strong,
deep voice. Luke Evans is quite a performer and singer who does a great
job portraying Gaston even without being the size of a barge. The voice
actors did a superb job as well. Josh Gad was very good, and for some
will be an acquired taste. Treat yourself to a second viewing; you will
not regret it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Good overall, but something seems a bit off<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
As far as Disney&#x27;s live action remakes go, I&#x27;d honestly have to say
that this is my favourite one so far. I went into the cinema with
pretty low expectations - I remembered how the 2015 remake of
Cinderella had played out: it was an okay film, but it was just okay,
and it didn&#x27;t really do the original animated film much justice. That
was what I was expecting with Beauty and the Beast.It turned out a lot better than I thought it would. I really like how
the Beast&#x27;s character has been built up more in this version - they
actually gave him a backstory, which was something that I had always
felt was lacking in the original animated film. And a few plot holes
from the original story are filled (i.e. how come nobody knows that
there&#x27;s a huge castle in the forest next to the village, why does
nobody remember the prince, etc.). And the idea that the servants in
the castle could have had family in the village was something that
honestly never even occurred to me whilst watching the animated film.
In the original movie, the Beast&#x27;s castle just seems so displaced from
the rest of the village, it is honestly very difficult to remember that
it isn&#x27;t that far away from Belle&#x27;s hometown. That definitely is not
the case in the remake.However, something just seemed very... off. And when I got halfway
through the movie, I realized what it was. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was
watching Emma Watson playing Belle. I felt like I was watching Emma
Watson playing Emma Watson.Perhaps it is just because I am so used to seeing her in roles similar
to Hermione in Harry Potter, but even her performance in Noah reminded
me of her portrayal of Belle here...I would still recommend seeing this if you are a fan of the animated
movie, or even if you&#x27;re just a fan of the fairy-tale (or just
fairy-tales in general). It is a very visually beautiful movie. But if
you&#x27;re expecting something that is completely true to the original
film, you may leave disappointed. A few things have been added in - the
basic plot stays the same, but it is not a perfect copy of the animated
movie.

innovation.However,I think it is quite wise that they didn&#x27;t change the
story which is already perfect. Actually, I am stunned by Emma for her
true love. everything is perfect.

As a child, I absolutely adored the original version of this movie and
was very excited to see this at the cinema when I heard that it was
going to be coming out. It was my favorite growing up and because of
this, I was a little nervous as to whether or not it was going to be
done in the right way. I was not disappointed. Emma Watson was stunning as Belle, and I can&#x27;t imagine any other
actress nailing the role as she did. So many memories were brought back
whilst watching her at the beginning of the film with that classic blue
dress she wore around the village! I was transported back into my
childhood with her and thoroughly enjoyed watching her on screen. In
particular, I thought that the actor that played Gaston was also
excellent. The story-line stays faithful to the original with a few good
surprises! As a whole, it was done so beautifully, I really just cannot
praise it enough. The costumes, the singing, the choice of cast, the
animation of the castle&#x27;s furniture - perfect. If you loved the original, please ignore the negative comments/reviews
you have read here and just go and see it for yourself! It is truly an
amazing experience and like I said above, especially if you were a big
fan as a child - you will enjoy it just as much now.

Don&#x27;t be misled by other reviews on this page. This is a great movie.It had substance and added multiple layers to the original Disney
telling of the story.And the music is phenomenal. Alan Menken does it again, adding original
music to the great repertoire of music that the original had.If you want to watch what will be known as one of the great movies of
2017 then see this telling of the Beauty and the Beast.DO NOT PAY ANY MIND TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Visuals Are a Beauty, The Charm Is A Bit More Beast<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
It&#x27;s finally here, the live action telling of a beloved story that
Disney made memorable years ago. Yes, I&#x27;m talking about Beauty and The
Beast my friends, and tonight I&#x27;m here to share my thoughts. Now let&#x27;s
get this laid down now, I&#x27;m going to look at it as its own movie and do
my best to minimize the masterpiece. So please don&#x27;t cast aside the
review if I tread on any ground. With that said, let&#x27;s get started to
see if the modern retelling has what it takes to stand out in the
world. Summary: You may hear others say the movie is spot on with the 1991
telling. Not entirely true, but this rendition keeps about 80% of the
Tale as Old as Time to please the classic fans, while adding some
tangents to give it a twist. To quote a friend, &#x22;the new spins are
built around the fans from the 90s generation to entertain&#x22;. It works
for the most part, adding depth to the characters and giving the
emotional kick older audience members will appreciate. And while
sticking to the story is good start, the next magical step is how well
they brought it to life in the visuals. Beauty and The Beasts charming
country side and castles, are brought out in spectacular detail via
breathtaking scenery shots and detail oriented settings that are worthy
of recognition. Next dress our characters in wonderful costumes fitting
of the landscape, with special emphasis on the traditional Belle Dress
and Beast coat that remains timeless, and you again get more magic.
Finally add in the animation, realistic, fluid, and somewhat mirroring
the classic style most fell in love with, and you have a great
combination. Of note, there are times when things get trippy, or not
done quite as well, but overall solid around. All in all, Disney&#x27;s
abilities to blend these elements together are impressive, and this
reviewer gives them their well-deserved props. In terms of casting, there is a mixed response to the cast assembled.
Again, they are not the originals (which I did miss), but that doesn&#x27;t
mean they aren&#x27;t bad just the same. Emma Watson is charming, smart, and
courageous (all elements we have seen just without the wand), which
works for the protagonist. Dan Stevens I guess does well for the few
scenes he isn&#x27;t covered in CGI fir, but in his monstrous form delivers
his lines with surprising depth. But it is Lumiere and Cogsworth who
stole the show for me. I worried, I&#x27;d be robbed of their relationship,
but that wasn&#x27;t the case. Ewen McGreggor and Ian McKellan stepped up
the role, delivering their well- written lines that had me laughing in
delight. The rest did well, but I need to move on, so let&#x27;s just say
for the most part, this movie&#x27;s casting was well-done. Summary: The music, a staple of Beauty and The Beast that is almost as
timeless as the story. This rendition has put their own spin on it,
while trying to keep the backbone of the original. Most numbers work,
albeit obviously auto-tuned, with their own whim, but the song Gaston
was a number I did not enjoy for everything it lacked. Ironically the
original tunes I found to be better composed, packed with emotion and
not seeming a diluted version, but its weakness came in how they seemed
randomly thrown in (yes in an effort to add more emotional develop to
the cast). Overall the changes aren&#x27;t terrible, they just didn&#x27;t have
the same bite as the classics did, unless you count shock factor from
either some cheesiness/trippiness). Other changes that I didn&#x27;t quite like were Le Fou&#x27;s changes. Le Fou is
supposed to be his name sake, the fool who is comedic relief as the
joke, before getting his just desserts. Josh Gadd&#x27;s rendition wasn&#x27;t so
much a fool, as a smart alec, clingy, admirer who made slick comments
and kept his idol at bay. Again, the deeper development is appreciated,
but this drastic change kind of meant his name should have been changed
as well, perhaps to Petit Malin? Changes aside, the acting is capable
of bringing the characters to life, but there are moments where things
are a little forced. Some of the Beasts Temper tantrums, a few of
Belle&#x27;s stoic speeches, and Gaston&#x27;s attempts to be devious, all of
these hit their overacted moments at times. And while this made me
laugh, there were a few conventional moments that were a bit cheesy (as
stated by some in the movie). Most of these coincidental moments are
ignorable, but one scene in particular was an anticlimactic finish at
the end where something just happened to break at the right time. All of these moments alone aren&#x27;t too bad, but many of the changes
brought into this film brought it more into the adult/realistic and
took away from the fun, whimsical nature of the movie. The design of
the characters, the emotional subplots, even the music were lacking
that element of childlike fun that made the movie so memorable for me.
Doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t still entertaining, I just really missed that
element. The VERDICT:With the big shoes the original left, this telling did a decent job
appealing to many. It is a well- developed remake of the story, with a
wonderful cast and setting to bring it to life and capture your heart.
While the music didn&#x27;t quite reach the same heights, and some changes
took away the energy, this film certainly has much of the magic that
rose promised years ago. Go in there with a clear mind and try not to
compare, and you&#x27;ll be fine. I recommend this for a theater visit (as
if I could stop you) and hope you enjoy. My scores are: Family/Fantasy/Musical: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>It has its faults but OMG<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I LOVE Beauty and the Beast, the original, and honestly this one is SO
true to the original, which for me is a must. This was true for the
overall story/scenes and dialogue. There were some new scenes though,
which in my opinion were very fitting and simply just great (really
loved the Paris scene). I know A LOT of people have been complaining about the CGI, I
personally don&#x27;t get it. I mean, obviously it doesn&#x27;t look like REAL
people but for me that&#x27;s not really a problem. I mean it is a fairy
tale after all but now with real people (aka I really just see it as a
perk, having it a bit more &#x22;alive&#x22; instead of cartoons). And Beast
looked great, haha. He does look like does in the original. I don&#x27;t get
the goat-comments. Well, I understand where they&#x27;re coming from, I just
don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad thing. I do though, have some criticism. Both me and my brother (who I saw it
with, both 90&#x27;s kids *woop woop*) thought Gaston was a bit
to...inconsistent. Not acting wise. Luke Evans was amazing. No,
character wise. Haha, he was a bit too nice weirdly enough and then BAM
he was mean, EVIL and screaming. He was not as obnoxious as in the
original(I almost felt sorry for him when Belle turned him down, aww),
but much more brutal (I mean, three shots, really?!). To conclude, I
wanted him to be more of a villain and with an escalating evil rather
than him being kind of manic. Also, I love Emma, I really do, and I think she did a splendid job, but
the singing was... alright. You could hear the auto-tune (my
musician-brother said it isn&#x27;t actually auto-tune, but I can&#x27;t remember
what it&#x27;s called. To us normal people - auto-tune.), which, I at least,
did not hear with the others. But it was good. I reacted, mjeh, and I
moved on. Otherwise: I cried all through the last 20 minutes, as well as some 1,
2, 5 times through the whole thing but to be fair I&#x27;m a complete sucker
for, well, everything and also, it was just so nostalgic! Oh, and the
gay-hint, the trans-hint, diversity and added comedy; just very good
steps in the right direction. Loved it!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Despite Some Pacing Issues And A Few Technical Flaws, &#x22;Beauty And The Beast&#x22; Is Still A Magnificent, Magical Journey Boosted By Strong Performances From Its Lead Actors<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
&#x22;Beauty And The Beast&#x22; is Disney&#x27;s fourth live-action remake of a
classic animated film, is directed by Bill Condon, and star Emma Watson
as Belle, a bookworm who goes a castle holding a beast who has been
coursed and they start to fall in love with each while Gaston (Luke
Evans) has other plans. I was really looking forward to this film after seeing &#x22;The Jungle
Book,&#x22; and seeing how well Disney pulled off that magic, and thankfully
it worked in this film. Not as good as the animated classic, but a very
strong-live action remake.Emma Watson does a very good job as Belle. I can see this as a career
revival for Emma. Looking at her films between Harry Potter and this, I
think a lot of people didn&#x27;t really know where her acting career was
going. And goddamn can she sing. Her voice is magnificent. Who knew she
could belt those high notes. A movie like this has to have good
chemistry from its two leads. if it doesn&#x27;t, this movie would have
failed, but luckily, she and Dan Stevens make a great team and their
chemistry together is really realized in a lot of the bonding scenes in
this film.Let&#x27;s talk about Luke Evans as Gaston for a moment. Luke Evans proves
why he is one of the best actors working today. Gaston was villainous,
he was evil, downright unlikeable, like a classic Disney villain or any
movie villain for that matter should be, and it really helped that he
was portrayed by someone like Luke Evans. Evans gives it his all and
the supporting cast does as well, as not one single one of them has a
bad singing voice.Some of the songs were extended, which I liked. The &#x22;Gaston&#x22; song was
extended for this movie to show just how evil the dude really is, and I
appreciated that. All of the classics from the original animated film
are in here like &#x22;Belle,&#x22; &#x22;Be Our Guest,&#x22; &#x22;Beauty And The Beast,&#x22;
&#x22;Gaston,&#x22; and &#x22;Kill the Beast.&#x22; My only problem with so many songs and
an added 40 minutes on the runtime compared to the original is that at
times it feels like this film can be a bit slow. You feel like you&#x27;re a
lot further into this film than you really are and you realize that
sometimes a couple of the songs drag. There also some times that the CGI with the Beast bothered me. It
didn&#x27;t look very smooth in these scenes when it was mostly flawless for
the rest of the film. I&#x27;ve talked to other people about this and they
say they didn&#x27;t notice it, but for some reason I did, and it stuck out
so I had to talk about a technical flaw I saw.This vision is well realized. The world this film portrays portrays it
in a way that is believable. You believe this place actually exists and
is fantasy world that people like Belle could live in. I really liked
this movie, and am looking forward to many more Disney live-action
remakes.I am going to give &#x22;Beauty And The Beast&#x22; an 8.5/10.You can find my video review of &#x22;Beauty And The Beast&#x22; on YouTube

I absolutely LOVE Beauty and the Beast. I have always loved Belle,
since I was a 1 year old. And still do, she is my favorite Disney
Princess. This movie is AMAZING and brought tears to my eyes. I
especially love Emma Watson in this film. She was FANTASTIC!! The role
of Belle fit her perfectly! I could watch this movie over and over and
not get bored. Great Job!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Even better than the original. Complainers are off base.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
About the only thing about this version that was not as good as the old
one is Beauty and the Beast in the closing credits. It was so excellent
to see actual humans rather than animation performing the parts. Emma
Watson was surprisingly strong acting and singing the part of Belle.
The beast played by Dan Stevens was more humorous but less comical and
more believable than the animated one. All the performances were quite
good. Sure Emma Thompson was not quite as wonderful as Angela Lansbury,
but was still very good. Luke Evans played an excellently despicable
Gaston. I liked all the directorial choices and every change made from
the original was an improvement. Masterful job Disney in updating this
classic.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is a faithful, entertaining and&#x85; beautiful live-action rendition of the beloved Disney animated classic.<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Most people are aware that Disney&#x27;s 2017 musical fantasy &#x22;Beauty and
the Beast&#x22; (PG, 2:09) is a live-action remake of the studio&#x27;s 1991
animated classic, but what is not as well known is just how successful
that 1991 version was &#x96; or how long the story has been around.
According to Wikipedia, university researchers in Europe have traced
the story&#x27;s origins back 4,000 years! A little more recently, it&#x27;s
likely that the tale (which seems like it just may be nearly as old as
time) was influenced by the true story of Petrus Gonsalvus, a 16th
century Spaniard who suffered from Hypertrichosis (extreme hair
growth), but married a Parisian woman, fathered seven children (four of
whom inherited his disease) and lived among the French nobility.
Regardless of its original source, the story was first published in
France in 1740 and, over the next three centuries, was revised,
rewritten and adapted, both in print and then as performance art,
including about a dozen television shows and about the same number of
feature films. Probably the most famous cinematic version was Disney&#x27;s
1991 animated musical which won Oscars for its score and its title song
(and was nominated for Best Picture &#x96; the very first animated feature
so honored) and made almost half a billion dollars worldwide. That 1991
film incorporates several elements and plot points from the story&#x27;s
early published versions. The 2017 version does the same &#x96; and serves
as a very faithful live-action re-telling of the 1991 classic, with few
significant differences.Emma Watson plays Belle (the character simply referred to as Beauty in
most of the earlier versions of the story), a beautiful, kind,
intelligent and independent young woman living in the fictional French
village of Villeneuve (named after the author who first published the
story). Belle lives with her eccentric and devoted widowed father,
Maurice (Kevin Kline), who is the only one who understands Belle and
accepts her for who she is. While her fellow villagers dismiss her as
&#x22;odd&#x22; for always reading books and dreaming about life and adventures
beyond Villeneuve, she is nevertheless being pursued romantically by
arrogant former soldier Gaston (Luke Evans), who sees Belle&#x27;s beauty as
at least approaching his own. (To say that Gaston&#x27;s narcissistic is
like saying Donald Trump is kind of proud of his accomplishments.) And
not that Gaston&#x27;s ego needs any boosting, but constantly at his side is
LeFou (Josh Gad), who basically serves as Gaston&#x27;s hype man&#x85; and who
seems jealous of all the local maidens competing for Gaston&#x27;s
attention. Regardless, Gaston wants Belle and Belle wants... nothing to
do with Gaston.Meanwhile, the other character in the film&#x27;s title is wasting away in a
long-forgotten castle deep in the woods outside of Villeneuve. Beast
(Dan Stevens) is a former prince who is now a unique fusion of several
different wild animals, due to a curse he received from a local
enchantress because of his extreme self-centeredness. Trapped in the
same curse are his former castle staff, who now exist as
anthropomorphic household objects including a candelabra named Lumi&#xE8;re
(voiced by Ewan McGregor), a clock called Cogsworth (Ian McKellan), a
tea pot (Emma Thompson), a harpsicord (Stanley Tucci), a dresser (Audra
McDonald) and a feather duster (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The only way that any
(all) of them can be released from the curse is if Beast falls in love
and is loved in return, before a rose that was given to Beast as a
symbol of the curse loses its last petal. Considering that Beast has
grown bitter and mean and no one even knows that he exists, the
long-term prospects for this cursed castle&#x85; don&#x27;t look good.Of course, all that changes when these two worlds inevitably collide.
(After all, movies simply called &#x22;Beast&#x22;, or &#x22;Beauty And&#x22; don&#x27;t sound
very interesting, do they?) When Maurice gets lost in the woods on the
way back from his annual trip to market, he ends up at Beast&#x27;s castle,
where he takes a rose to bring to Belle and is promptly imprisoned in
Beast&#x27;s dungeon. When Maurice&#x27;s faithful horse returns to Villeneuve
and Belle hops on, she also discovers Beast&#x27;s castle. She insists on
taking her father&#x27;s place in the dungeon, so Beast throws him out and
holds Belle captive. As Maurice struggles to get Gaston (or any of the
villagers) to help him rescue Belle (or even to believe his story of a
beast living in a castle deep in the woods), Beast&#x27;s staff insists that
Belle&#x85; be their guest, and they work to convince Beast to be nice
enough to her that she might turn out to be the one to break the curse&#x85;
before it&#x27;s too late.&#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is a faithful, entertaining and&#x85; beautiful
live-action rendition of the beloved Disney animated classic. The 2017
version keeps the time-honored songs from the 1991 film and adds a few
new ones. With the advances in CGI since 1991, director Bill Condon and
his team are able to replicate and update the look of the animated
version. In addition, the great voice work wonderfully complements the
vibrant visuals, while the characters&#x27; diversity (in terms of race and
sexual orientation) also represents an update of sorts. The result of
all this is a remake that is every bit as magical and fun as the
original. There is little here that&#x27;s fresh or new, but there&#x27;s a lot
to appreciate and enjoy. &#x22;A-&#x22;

Disney&#x27;s &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; is a re-telling of the studio&#x27;s
animated classic which refashions the classic characters from the tale
for a contemporary audience, staying true to the original music while
updating the score with several new songs. There&#x27;s an emotional
authenticity in director Bill Condon&#x27;s live-action film that helps you
rediscover Disney&#x27;s beloved 1991 animated movie that is also performed
with exquisite timing and grace by the outstanding cast. But the
problem here, I think, is weirdly simple. This Beauty as well-
designed, entertaining and romantic it is, it made me want to revisit
the original.

I was sceptical about this Project, especially because it is based on
one of the animated classics that defined my childhood. I was scared
they wouldn&#x27;t capture the soul and Magic of it. It turns out they did.
At least most of it. I was really positivly surprised that it was done
so well. Many criticize it for being a 1:1 Remake of the original but
to be honest, that is exactly what I wanted it to be. I didn&#x27;t want
them to Change things, reinterpret things, because we have seen that
before in other Versions of &#x22;Beauty and the Beast&#x22; and it never worked.
No they kept it the same, Frame by Frame just live Action which was the
right Thing to do. They added some more Scenes to give the characters
more depths which was a nice addition as it all fits the characters.
Some of the new Songs were great too. (the Beast finally sings!) Acting
wise it was nothing to write home about but not bad either. Not too
sure about Emma Watson as Belle, although she was fine, she never
really entered the character as much as I wanted her too, it was often
a little shallow. Dan Stevens as the Beast was great, captured most of
the needed elements of the role. The strength of the cast lies in the
voice work (and live Action work too) of the supporting Players, mostly
Ewan McGregor and especially Emma Thompson. I also loved Ian McKellen
and Stanley Tucci had his moments, too. Luke Evans was okay, but I
hoped he would be more self ironic. Kevin Kline held himself well, but
can do even better. Inspired casting choice however. I cannout complain
much about Bill Condon&#x27;s direction which was well enough especially
during the Musical numbers. Great choreography. Costumes and Production
desigsn should get some notes next Oscar seaosn. All in all a beautiful
Ferry tale that totally worked for me.

I VERY rarely ever give out a 10 of 10 rating... I also even more
rarely write a review on a movie, but after watching this spectacular
movie I had to share my humble opinion with the world.If you were a fan of the original you will adore this movie. My best
friend brought to my attention something that helped me understand why
everyone should give any remake of a classic a chance. After a while
you&#x27;ve seen the classic so much, that you may stop watching it...it
could be because your brain has it memorized and you can just play it
over and over again in your head and not have to watch it, but more
likely it may be because you just get tired of seeing it so much so you
enjoy it on rare occasions (May 4th when I watch all the Star Wars
movies)...BUT a remake either spices it up OR it makes you take the
original out and WANT to watch it again...THIS MOVIE DOES BOTH!!! The
music, the songs, the characters, the addition of back story....all of
it instilled that magical feeling of wonderment that the original movie
did so well at doing when I was only 10 years old (excluding the back
story part because the original didn&#x27;t do that as well). There was also
a few new songs to now learn.The costumes, make-up, and visuals had that wonderful flare of France
to match the period and location of where the story was set to take
place. There was also a lot of clever hidden jokes to keep the adults
chuckling, the kids asking, and the adults saying &#x22;Ill tell you when
you&#x27;re older&#x22; knowing good and damn well that you aren&#x27;t going to tell
them anything. LOL (I&#x27;m older now, though) :) So, in conclusion if you
are a fan of the original go see it you&#x27;ll appreciate that they changed
very little and the parts they might have changed (which I didn&#x27;t
notice much) just added a magical flare to the movie.If you never saw the original, go see this movie you&#x27;ll love it!!! It
stands alone as a great story.If you saw the original, but you are not a fan of remakes...just give
it a shot! As a slightly skeptical fan of remakes, I personally enjoyed
it VERY MUCH!

This is more than an extraordinary remarkable movie. Don&#x27;t give
attention to the negative reviews. In general , the movie was at it
best. For transforming an animation movie to a reality is by itself a
hard work to be as exactly identical, since animations are animations
and imaginary. I believe that the movie was made at its best and won&#x27;t
be done better. It&#x27;s true that in some scenes the act was a bit shallow
and vague, but if you look at the scene from a realistic perspective
rather than exactly copying the scenes in your mind and comparing it to
the animation, then you will simply love and appreciate this movie. In
the end, believe me, you will leave from this movie clapping and filled
with joy, happiness and love. A MUST WATCH for Disney lovers !!!

Just saw this and wow all I can say is wow! I know people have their
views on these Disney live action films but people need to realize that
Disney knows these films will never ever be like the animated versions.
But, in my opinion I love this just as much as the animated version.
There was such magic and wonder and adventure in this film!! Emma
really shows so much heart and strength to this role and she really is
Belle! All of the other characters are so great as well!! I got
goosebumps to the core when I saw this and I wanna see it again! :)
Emma gives so much to her role as Belle and she is so strong but can
also have a quiet confidence to her. She is everything you love about
Belle and more and I think her singing voice is so pretty and Dan
Stevens voice as the beast is so great and his song evermore that he
sings is so beautiful!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Magical From Start To Finish<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
Having grown up with the animated Beauty and the Beast, I could not
wait to see this live-action version. Not only was I not disappointed,
but the movie exceeded any expectations I had going in. The movie is
magical from start to finish, full of familiar characters, songs,
stories, and places. It introduces us to plenty of new characters,
songs, stories, and places but does so in a way that respects and
enhances all that was original. The blend of old and new is wonderfully
done. The humor sprinkled throughout was a fun touch. The musical
numbers were amazing, especially &#x22;Be Our Guest&#x22;. Some reviewers have pointed out flaws in the CGI and Emma Watson&#x27;s
portrayal of Belle. I looked for and did not spot any obvious or
distracting CGI elements. The characters looked realistic but still had
a sense of whimsy to them. Emma was stunning as Belle. Everything from
her singing voice to the intelligence and strong will she showed
through the character was fantastic. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of the
original movie and can go into this one with an open mind. It does
contain some scary moments and mild violence though, so I would caution
parents of young children to research it or see it first.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Disney did not disappoint...<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
The 1991 animated feature is no doubt one of Disney&#x27;s masterpieces. I,
for one have seen it a countless number of times, and since the day of
the Disney announced the 2017-remake, I hoped that the live-action
version would encompass all the things that made the company&#x27;s original
feature so great. I was not disappointed. All they really needed to do was stick to original design of the movie,
which is what they did, essentially. They may have tweaked a few
details and added a few things to the storyline, but I felt that in
doing so, they added more depth to the characters, as well as the
story. What I particularly liked was that they really worked on the
relationship between Belle and Beast. In the original animated feature,
the two were completely different, and there was not a lot commonality.
The live-action feature included certain scenes where the two
characters bonded on a more emotional and intellectual level. They
seemed to be more compatible, and I truly felt that this made their
love story even more powerful than the original. The set design and the costumes were spectacular, no question about
that.My only complaint would have to be that I was not a big fan of Emma
Watson&#x27;s portrayal of Belle. She was beautiful, no doubt, her singing
was alright but there was just something missing. There was a certain
amount of stiffness to her performance and I just could not shake that
off.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>SPOILER ALERT- Magical<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
*SPOILER WARNING*First off: Casting Emma Watson as Belle- I think she&#x27;s the closest
person to Belle in the world. I thought that she didn&#x27;t necessarily
have the singing chops for the role, but having big shoes to fill, I
think she handled it well.Dan Stevens as the Beast- I really can&#x27;t imagine any other person
playing the Beast, he has a great voice, and his emotion is incredible
and his acting itself is great.Luke Evans as Gaston- I was rather upset that he physically looked
nothing like the cartoon Gaston at first, but I grew to love him as an
actor and in the end, his performance was outstanding.Josh Gad as LeFou- Even though I could only hear Olaf the Snowman
throughout the whole movie, I LOVED his performance. He&#x27;s the perfect
real life look alike of LeFou and his representation of LeFou was just
incredible. He was perfect for the role.Ewan McGregor as Lumiere- I seriously can&#x27;t imagine a more perfect
person for this role. He&#x27;s a good looking guy, he DEFINITELY had the
singing voice for this role as you can tell by his performance in
Moulin Rouge, and he also has the acting skills. And his French accent
sounded quite accurate to me. The way he portrayed the beloved
candelabrum in this movie was outstanding.Ian McKellen as Cogsworth- As a fan of McKellen&#x27;s work, I was so
intrigued to hear that he would be portraying the iconic Mantle Clock
in this new movie! There was no negatives to his work during this live
action motion picture.Secondly: The Music&#x22;Be our Guest&#x22; BLEW me away! They clearly poured their blood, sweat and
tears into creating that magical, classic musical number and that makes
it so much more magical. And, if your&#x27;re a musical fan, you&#x27;ll love
this number, considering there are several hidden references to classic
musicals during the song. And like I said before, I loved Ewan
McGregor&#x27;s vocals during this song.&#x22;Gaston&#x22; this number specifically stole the show for me. With Josh
Gad&#x27;s performance, you can&#x27;t take his eyes off him! He&#x27;s so
entertaining, and the clear friendly chemistry during LeFou and Gaston
was so great. Josh Gad and Luke Evans both blew me away during this
song and it was my favorite musical number in the movie.The new songs: &#x22;How Does A Moment Last Forever&#x22; Sang by both Maurice
and Belle in the movie. I preferred Celine&#x27;s rendition which played in
the credits. When Celine sang it, I understood the true emotion.&#x22;Days In The Sun&#x22; This was one of my favorite songs in this new movie.
It&#x27;s about all of the enchanted objects singing about their lives as
humans and how they would enjoy more days in the sun instead of being
trapped inside the castle. This song was so sad to me considering, the
enchanted objects don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll stay as objects forever, and
this song hit me hard for some reason.&#x22;Evermore&#x22; By far my favorite song from the new song, sang by the
Beast. This was the one musical number that actually made me cry. It
was so incredibly sad because it took place right after the Beast
released Belle to go help her father. And he&#x27;s singing about his inner
devotion for Belle but he knows that she will likely never come back to
him or love him back, so he has to stay in the tower forever.Thirdly: New elements to the storyThe curse- The enchantress removed all memory of the castle from the
people who lived in the village, so now that makes sense why none of
the villagers remembered it. The rose, doesn&#x27;t have a specific year
count for how long the Beast has to break the curse, he just has until
all of the petals fall, not specifically ten years anymore.The book- The enchantress also gave the Beast a book that allows him to
travel, his only other view to the outside world. So him and Belle
traveled to Belle&#x27;s childhood home in Paris to find out what happened
to her mother, her mother died of the Plague. For some reason Maurice
could never bring himself to tell Belle what happened to her mother,
they made it seem like some heartbreaking, crazy thing happened to her
mother, but she only died of the Plague.The enchanted objects- In the cartoon, after 10 years, the objects
would stay the enchanted objects forever. But, in this version, after
all the rose petals die, the actually became inanimate. They won&#x27;t be
able to walk anymore, or talk. They would become lifeless. I think that
added much more pressure to the Beast, because if he didn&#x27;t break the
spell, all of his servants would actually die. And that just made the
movie way more emotional whenever all the petals fell, and the Beast
ran out of time. LGBTQ+- There has been so much controversy with LeFou being openly gay
as stated by director, Bill Condon. The movie was canceled from a lot
of theaters due to that statement. But seeing the movie, I was
disappointed, LeFou never came out and said he was gay and it honestly
wasn&#x27;t too obvious. It was blown way too out of proportion. Although,
during the celebration dance at the end of the movie, LeFou began
dancing with a man, that scene only lasted a second and a blink of the
eye could miss it. And during the fight scene when the villagers
invaded the castle. Madame De Garderobe, the Wardrobe, dressed up three
men as women. Two of the men ran away screaming, while one man smiled
and walked away with pride and confidence. I loved that scene so much.Overall, I think this was the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen in my whole
life. It was so emotional and I recommend it.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>I Actually Loved This Remake. I Thought It Was A Lot Like The Original<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
WILL INVOLVE SPOILERS!I was actually kind of surprised by this remake of Beauty And The Beast
and I am writing this review after getting out of the theaters. I
actually thought the casting was great and some of the changes were
great. And actually the remake was a lot like the original to me. It
seems like many people were disappointed because they had British
actors and a few other actors who weren&#x27;t and were American instead of
French ones like in the original. Um...hello?! Did you see the original
where they had American actors act out in the original?! Or maybe
people thought the people who played Belle (Watson) or Gaston (Evans)
were not the right cast because Belle wasn&#x27;t as &#x22;good looking&#x22; as the
original or Gaston wasn&#x27;t as &#x22;deep voiced&#x22; or &#x22;buff&#x22; as the original;
or maybe because people expected more in the film, but the whole Belle
and Gaston case was what I mostly heard from people who were
disappointed in this remake. But no matter what those people thought, I
still thought this was a great remake. 10 out of 10 stars! I highly
recommend for people who love Emma Watson, and any Disney remake!

Disney&#x27;s concept of translating their classic animated hits into live
action blockbusters started quite messy, but since then, they seem to
do it very well. I think they have got the knack.Beauty and the Beast is largely similar to the animated movie, which is
basically what someone would want and expect from a remake. However, it
adds more depth to its story and characters, it makes the film&#x27;s
message stronger. It touches our heartstrings and gives us a wave of
nostalgia, while at the same time, it manages to improve - somehow - on
the animated film. Even if at the end, the original is better.Visually the film is stunning. Amazing colours, costumes, the visual
effects and sets are all very well done. It&#x27;s an artistic masterpiece.
The same thing can be said about its breathtaking music. The soundtrack
is simply perfect.That&#x27;s of course because of the very talented people working on it.
From the cast, who gives some incredible performances, to the director,
the composer etc.Overall I consider Beauty and the Beast a strong awards contender. It
could get nominations in several categories. Its only flaw is probably
that it&#x27;s just a bit too long, which is why some people might find it
overstuffed.
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Emma Watson Manages to be Luminous in an Already Vibrant Film<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
I&#x27;m utterly shocked by the negative backlash that this film has been
getting from critics and the public because it&#x27;s truly a joy to watch.
Bill Condon has done a wonderful job bringing the beloved animated
flick to life with a stellar cast, exceptional musical numbers, and
jaw-dropping sets and visuals (the ballroom scene had me in tears).
Also, Steven Chbosky and Even Spiliotopolous deserve credit as well as
they were able to conceive a screenplay that kept enough familiarity
with the original to give the audience some good-old nostalgia while
adding enough new details and subtle elements to keep the audience
invested in what&#x27;s going to happen next.The cast really carry the movie as well, with Luke Evans (Gaston), Dan
Stevens (the Beast), and Josh Gad (LeFou) entertaining the hell out of
me--Stevens is practically playing a completely different character,
and his performance creates a new and charming Beast (and damn, can he
sing!). Evans is absolutely perfect as Gaston, and although I don&#x27;t
love his singing voice for the character, he nailed every single line
he was given. Now, regarding the situation with LeFou; I really don&#x27;t
understand why Bill Condon went ahead and made a big deal about Josh
Gad&#x27;s character being gay because it&#x27;s barely present in the film.
Beauty and the Beast is now not likely to preform as well as it could
possibly have with foreign markets in addition to a bunch of local
conservatives throwing temper-tantrums (spamming the film with negative
&#x22;reviews&#x22;) for nothing; you blink and you&#x27;ll miss that &#x22;exclusively gay
moment&#x22;. As for Gad himself, his LeFou is charming and hilarious in his
own right--he&#x27;s certainly an extra viewing bonus. Kevin Kline is truly
a gift to the film; he does not play a small part and he has one little
song that he absolutely nails. The father-daughter bond between him and
Belle is truly spectacular. As for the rest cursed objects, I thought
they voiced their characters fine enough, but they weren&#x27;t what was
driving the film. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you otherwise, this is Emma Watson&#x27;s movie. And
boy, does she crush it as Belle. I can assume it was tough for her to
watch Emma Stone take home Best Actress for La La Land, but don&#x27;t
worry, Emma, because you&#x27;ve knocked it out of the park here. Watson&#x27;s
Belle is strong, independent, passionate, vigilant, and every other
adjective you could add to describe the perfect modern female heroine
in Disney- princess form. She is also adorably awkward at times,
something understandable since she&#x27;s lived as an outcast in her village
her whole life. The added backstory and quirks really make this
character all the more three- dimensional and they incorporate into the
movie beautifully. Emma really sells every one of her scenes, and her
Harry Potter days have seemed to have helped her out regarding working
with visual effects and acting off of nothing. I doubt the film would
be half as good if they had gotten anyone else to play Belle-- just
note that about 95% of the people claiming that she was wooden in the
film are either biased trolls, or more likely, people who haven&#x27;t even
seen the film yet.As for complaints about the movie, I have very few. Personally, it took
me about 10 minutes to truly get into it because it was such a strange
sensation to watch my childhood be portrayed by other people, plus all
of the songs felt like really weird covers of the original songs until
I really warmed to the new atmosphere. Also, they would introduce
fascinating details about the Beast that they never really seemed to do
anything with. Lastly, the third act is somewhat a competition between
the loud and over-the-top music numbers and the climatic state of the
plot for your attention. Although both are extremely entertaining, at
times the third act felt a little unfocused. However, I can assure you,
that the ending scene were Beast transforms is spectacular, both
Stevens and Watson do a terrific job expressing the same emotions
created 26 years ago.All in all, this is a wonderful movie. All the critics are kind of
saying the same thing: &#x22;if the original is so great, why remake it?&#x22;
and &#x22;it&#x27;s just a remake, nothing more&#x22;. Why does this film not deserve
credit for being a faithful yet fresh retelling of the tale as old as
time? In fact, it even improves upon some aspects of the original, such
as how Belle and Beast fall in love (just wait a couple weeks and see
the film and you&#x27;ll understand how). I have the answer: people simply
don&#x27;t want to like this movie. The original is so amazing and beloved
by practically the entire planet that Disney having the audacity to
come and revamp so many people&#x27;s childhoods for the sake of money is,
for many, very offensive--even if the movie&#x27;s actually really, really
good.

Seriously, how can this movie have a rating of 6,1/10 when the movie
have good reviews everywhere. Homophobes and Emma Watson haters are
here to make the score bad.That being said, this movie is simply incredible. The music, the
costumes and the production design are Oscar worthy. The visual effects
are stunning, but the CGI is not perfect. It&#x27;s my only complaint for
the movie.Emma Watson is the perfect Belle and a very good model for young girls.
Her Belle is a strong independent woman but fall in love like everyone
else. Dan is a very good singer and his Beast is even better than the
original.All the supporting cast is PERFECT. Top notch. I have nothing bad to
say about it.This movie will make billions. It&#x27;s simply heartbreaking and magical at
the same time. I&#x27;m sure the score will go up when the movie will open
in cinemas.Simply the best Disney live action movie ever. Period.

Bill Condon&#x27;s adaptation of Beauty and the Beast is nothing short of
amazing. Being a fan of the original Beauty and The Beast I was a
little nervous going in to the cinema. I really wanted them to get the
film right, and they did! The score is genius, the costume design is
superb, the production design is great, the direction is amazing. This
film was so visually stunning and I couldn&#x27;t of hoped for better!
<EndCommenttext> <StartTitletext>Pure Magic- wonderful movie<EndTitletext>  <StartCommenttext>
This movie is pure magic. Cast, production designs, direction, acting
and cinematography is on point.This live action makes you believe that
fairy tales can be real. It stays true to original and builds on it. It
is much more layered and sophisticated. However,i have to agree some
things feel extra in this version. New songs are really good but are
not better than original ones.Emma Watson proves herself to be a live
action Disney princess.The transformation is complete.She is a
wonderful heroine and role model for everyone.She gives this role
everything she has. I have never seen her doing this great before.Her
performance is absolutely perfect. This should be a career defining
role for her. Her singing was good and much less auto-tuned. Acting
wise, she was a solid choice. Overall, the CGI on objects was great.
All voice actors have done wonderful job. Kevin Kline is such a gift to
this film. He has a tiny little song which i think he nails. THE bond
between belle and her father is just loving and charming. The only
drawback is that the beast looks unfinished and fake at times but Dan
Stevens has done a wonderful job. His song &#x27;Evermore&#x27;&#x27; is great and
very emotional. The ballroom scene is spectacular. The transformation
scene is well handled . As for LeFou, it was mistake for Disney to make
a big deal about him being their first ever gay character because it is
barely acknowledged in the film. There are two gay moments in the movie
which are barely noticeable and are just for laughs, neither one
involves Gaston. This movie just acknowledges that LGBT people exist
and leFou happens to be one of them. Nothing more than this. Luke Evans
as Gaston has done an incredible job and he is a lot more evil in this
version. Beauty and the beast is a perfect movie and maintains the
charm of original animated movie. It is really sad that some people are
trying to assassinate this wonderful movie. Everybody should go and see
this movie.
